abstract: Due to the climate crisis, summers in Greenland have been rapidly getting
  warmer, causing increasing rates of ice melt on the Greenland ice sheet and speeding
  up sea-level rise. Evidence of this change can be measured by the number and location
  (elevation) of water pools and lakes that form on the surface of the ice sheet.
  In addition, crevasses can cause lakes to drain extremely rapidly causing the ice
  to flow faster, contributing to sea-level rise. However, the lack of annotated data
  makes it difficult to automatically detect and track these behavioral changes in
  the polar ice sheet lakes. This study describes how a team of polar and data scientists
  actively engaged middle and high school students in their classrooms in a data annotation
  process through an engaging curriculum unit to identify multiple ice sheet phenomena
  observed in satellite imagery. The findings describe the learning outcomes from
  both student and teacher perspectives. It also projects learners' understanding
  and sentiments about climate change and the role of artificial intelligence (AI)
  models coupled as an extension of citizen science in addressing climate change.
