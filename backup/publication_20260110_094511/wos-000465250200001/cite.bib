 abstract = {The oceanic response to recent tropical eruptions is examined in Large    Ensemble (LE) experiments from two fully coupled global climate models,
the Community Earth System Model (CESM) and the Geophysical Fluid
Dynamics Laboratory Earth System Model (ESM2M), each forced by a
distinct volcanic forcing dataset. Following the simulated eruptions of
Agung, El Chichon, and Pinatubo, the ocean loses heat and gains oxygen
and carbon, in general agreement with available observations. In both
models, substantial global surface cooling is accompanied by El
Nino-like equatorial Pacific surface warming a year after the volcanic
forcing peaks. A mechanistic analysis of the CESM and ESM2M responses to
Pinatubo identifies remote wind forcing from the western Pacific as a
major driver of this El Nino-like response. Following eruption, faster
cooling over the Maritime Continent than adjacent oceans suppresses
convection and leads to persistent westerly wind anomalies over the
western tropical Pacific. These wind anomalies excite equatorial
downwelling Kelvin waves and the upwelling of warm subsurface anomalies
in the eastern Pacific, promoting the development of El Nino conditions
through Bjerknes feedbacks a year after eruption. This El Nino-like
response drives further ocean heat loss through enhanced equatorial
cloud albedo, and dominates global carbon uptake as upwelling of
carbon-rich waters is suppressed in the tropical Pacific. Oxygen uptake
occurs primarily at high latitudes, where surface cooling intensifies
the ventilation of subtropical thermocline waters. These volcanically
forced ocean responses are large enough to contribute to the observed
decadal variability in oceanic heat, carbon, and oxygen.},
