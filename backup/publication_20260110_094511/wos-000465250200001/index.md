abstract: The oceanic response to recent tropical eruptions is examined in Large    Ensemble
  (LE) experiments from two fully coupled global climate models, the Community Earth
  System Model (CESM) and the Geophysical Fluid Dynamics Laboratory Earth System Model
  (ESM2M), each forced by a distinct volcanic forcing dataset. Following the simulated
  eruptions of Agung, El Chichon, and Pinatubo, the ocean loses heat and gains oxygen
  and carbon, in general agreement with available observations. In both models, substantial
  global surface cooling is accompanied by El Nino-like equatorial Pacific surface
  warming a year after the volcanic forcing peaks. A mechanistic analysis of the CESM
  and ESM2M responses to Pinatubo identifies remote wind forcing from the western
  Pacific as a major driver of this El Nino-like response. Following eruption, faster
  cooling over the Maritime Continent than adjacent oceans suppresses convection and
  leads to persistent westerly wind anomalies over the western tropical Pacific. These
  wind anomalies excite equatorial downwelling Kelvin waves and the upwelling of warm
  subsurface anomalies in the eastern Pacific, promoting the development of El Nino
  conditions through Bjerknes feedbacks a year after eruption. This El Nino-like response
  drives further ocean heat loss through enhanced equatorial cloud albedo, and dominates
  global carbon uptake as upwelling of carbon-rich waters is suppressed in the tropical
  Pacific. Oxygen uptake occurs primarily at high latitudes, where surface cooling
  intensifies the ventilation of subtropical thermocline waters. These volcanically
  forced ocean responses are large enough to contribute to the observed decadal variability
  in oceanic heat, carbon, and oxygen.
