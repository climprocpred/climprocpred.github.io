abstract: Given coarser-resolution projections from global climate models or satellite
  data, the downscaling problem aims to estimate finer-resolution regional climate
  data, capturing fine-scale spatial patterns and variability. Downscaling is any
  method to derive high-resolution data from low-resolution variables, often to provide
  more detailed and local predictions and analyses. This problem is societally crucial
  for effective adaptation, mitigation, and resilience against significant risks from
  climate change. The challenge arises from spatial heterogeneity and the need to
  recover finer-scale features while ensuring model generalization. Most downscaling
  methods [21] fail to capture the spatial dependencies at finer scales and underperform
  on real-world climate datasets, such as sea-level rise. We propose a novel Kriging-informed
  Conditional Diffusion Probabilistic Model (Ki-CDPM) to capture spatial variability
  while preserving fine-scale features. Experimental results on climate data show
  that our proposed method is more accurate than state-of-the-art downscaling techniques.
