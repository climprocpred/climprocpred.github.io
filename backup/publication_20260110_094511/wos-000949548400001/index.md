abstract: This paper examines the empirical relationship between the Madden-Julian    oscillation
  (MJO), the quasi-biennial oscillation (QBO), and atmospheric river (AR) activity
  and precipitation in California on subseasonal time scales. We introduce an experimental
  forecast tool that uses observed anomaly patterns during a 38 yr period to predict
  the probability of above- and below-normal AR activity and precipitation at lead
  times of 1-6 weeks based on the phase and amplitude of the MJO and QBO. The hindcast
  prediction skill of probabilistic AR activity and precipitation forecasts is evaluated
  for Northern, Central, and Southern California, as well as two sets of smaller geographical
  domains. These smaller domains are more relevant for water resource management and
  allow us to investigate the sensitivity of prediction skill to domain size. Consistent
  with previous studies, our results demonstrate that subseasonal AR activity and
  precipitation in California are strongly modulated by the MJO and QBO. The anomaly
  patterns of AR activity and precipitation vary considerably throughout the cool
  season, with a tendency toward below-normal AR activity and precipitation during
  easterly QBO and above-normal AR activity and precipitation during westerly QBO
  in JFM. The opposite patterns are generally observed in OND, but the anomaly signals
  are weaker and less coherent for AR activity. Certain combinations of MJO phase,
  QBO phase, lag time, and season yield notably higher skill scores, reinforcing the
  notion of ``windows of opportunity `` for skillful subseasonal-to-seasonal predictions.
  In California, these forecasts of opportunity are predominantly associated with
  easterly QBO in JFM and FMA.
