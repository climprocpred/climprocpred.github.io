abstract: The Climate SPHINX (Stochastic Physics HIgh resolutioN eXperiments)    project
  is a comprehensive set of ensemble simulations aimed at evaluating the sensitivity
  of present and future climate to model resolution and stochastic parameterisation.
  The EC-Earth Earth system model is used to explore the impact of stochastic physics
  in a large ensemble of 30-year climate integrations at five different atmospheric
  horizontal resolutions (from 125 up to 16 km). The project includes more than 120
  simulations in both a historical scenario (1979-2008) and a climate change projection
  (2039-2068), together with coupled transient runs (1850-2100). A total of 20.4 million
  core hours have been used, made available from a single year grant from PRACE (the
  Partnership for Advanced Computing in Europe), and close to 1.5 PB of output data
  have been produced on SuperMUC IBM Petascale System at the Leibniz Supercomputing
  Centre (LRZ) in Garching, Germany. About 140 TB of postprocessed data are stored
  on the CINECA supercomputing centre archives and are freely accessible to the community
  thanks to an EUDAT data pilot project. This paper presents the technical and scientific
  set-up of the experiments, including the details on the forcing used for the simulations
  performed, defining the SPHINX v1.0 protocol. In addition, an overview of preliminary
  results is given. An improvement in the simulation of Euro-Atlantic atmospheric
  blocking following resolution increase is observed. It is also shown that including
  stochastic parameterisation in the low-resolution runs helps to improve some aspects
  of the tropical climate -specifically the Madden-Julian Oscillation and the tropical
  rainfall variability. These findings show the importance of representing the impact
  of small-scale processes on the large-scale climate variability either explicitly
  (with highresolution simulations) or stochastically (in low-resolution simulations).
