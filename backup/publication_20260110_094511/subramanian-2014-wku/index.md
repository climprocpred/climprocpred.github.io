abstract: This study evaluates the Madden–Julian Oscillation (MJO) hindcast skill
  and investigates the hindcast biases in the dynamic and thermodynamic fields of
  the National Center for Atmospheric Research Community Atmosphere Model version
  3. The analysis is based on the October 2011 MJO event observed during the Dynamics
  of the Madden–Julian Oscillation field campaign. The model captures the MJO initiation
  but, compared to the observations, the hindcast has a faster MJO phase speed, a
  dry relative humidity bias, a stronger zonal wind shear, and a weaker MJO peak amplitude.
  The MJO hindcast is then nudged toward the European Centre for Medium‐Range Weather
  Forecast Reanalysis fields of temperature, specific humidity, horizontal winds,
  and surface pressure. The nudging tendencies highlight the model physics parameterization
  biases, such as not enough convective diabatic heating during the MJO initiation,
  not enough upper tropospheric stratiform condensation, and lower tropospheric reevaporation
  during the mature and decay phases and a strong zonal wind shear during the MJO
  evolution. To determine the role of temperature, specific humidity, and horizontal
  winds in the model physics parameterization errors, six additional nudging experiments
  are carried out, with either one or two of the fields allowed to evolve freely while
  the others are nudged. Results show that convection and precipitation increase when
  temperature or specific humidity are unconstrained and decrease when horizontal
  winds evolve freely or temperature alone is constrained to reanalysis. Budget analysis
  of moist static energy shows that the nudging tendency compensates for different
  process biases during different MJO phases. The diagnosis of such nudging tendencies
  provides a unique objective way to identify model physics biases, which usefully
  guides the model physics parameterization development. Evaluate MJO hindcast performance
  Relate MJO hindcast biases to model physics parameterizations Understand MJO mechanisms
