 abstract = {Subseasonal-to-seasonal (S2S) forecasts have the potential to provide    advance information about weather and climate events. The high heat
capacity of water means that the subsurface ocean stores and re-releases
heat (and other properties) and is an important source of information
for S2S forecasts. However, the subsurface ocean is challenging to
observe, because it cannot be measured by satellite. Subsurface ocean
observing systems relevant for understanding, modeling, and forecasting
on S2S timescales will continue to evolve with the improvement in
technological capabilities. The community must focus on designing and
implementing low-cost, high-value surface and subsurface ocean
observations, and developing forecasting system capable of extracting
their observation potential in forecast applications. S2S forecasts will
benefit significantly from higher spatio-temporal resolution data in
regions that are sources of predictability on these timescales (coastal,
tropical, and polar regions). While ENSO has been a driving force for
the design of the current observing system, the subseasonal time scales
present new observational requirements. Advanced observation
technologies such as autonomous surface and subsurface profiling devices
as well as satellites that observe the ocean-atmosphere interface
simultaneously can lead to breakthroughs in coupled data assimilation
(CDA) and coupled initialization for S2S forecasts.},
