 abstract = {The California Current System (CCS) has been studied by the California    Cooperative Oceanic Fisheries Investigations program for many decades.
Since 2004, the Southern California Bight (SCB) and the oceanic region
offshore has also been the site for the California Current Ecosystem
(CCE) Long-Term Ecological Research (LTER) program, which has
established long-term observational time series and executed several
Process Cruises to better understand physical biological variations,
fluxes and interactions. Since the inception of the CCE-LTER, many new
ideas have emerged about what physical processes are the key controls on
CCS dynamics. These new perspectives include obtaining a better
understanding of what climate patterns exert influences on CCS physical
variations and what physical controls are most important in driving CCE
ecological changes.
Physical oceanographic and climatological conditions in the CCS varied
widely since the inception of the CCE-LTER observational time series,
including unusual climate events and persistently anomalous states.
Although the CCE-LTER project commenced in 2004 in the midst of normal
ocean conditions near the climatological means, over the following
decade, El Nino/Southern Oscillation conditions flickered weakly from
warm to cold, with the Pacific Decadal Oscillation (PDO) generally
tracking that behavior, while the North Pacific Gyre Oscillation (NPGO)
evolved to persistent and strong positive conditions after 2007,
indicative of enhanced upwelling from 2007 to 2012. Together the
combined impact of the negative PDO state (La Nina conditions) and
positive NPGO state (increased upwelling conditions) yielded remarkably
persistent cool conditions in the CCS from late 2007 to early 2009 and
from mid-2010 through 2012.
The broad-scale climate variations that occurred over the North Pacific
and CCS during this time period are discussed here to provide physical
context for the CCE-LTER time series observations and the CCE-LTER
Process Cruises. Data assimilation fits, using the Regional Ocean
Modeling System four-dimensional data assimilation framework, were
successfully executed for the 1-month time period surrounding each of
the Process Cruises. The fits provide additional information about how
the physical flows evolve during the course of the multi-week Process
Cruises. Relating these physical states to the numerous biological
measurements gathered by the CCE-LTER time series observations and
during the Process Cruises will yield vital long-term perspective of how
changing climate conditions control the ocean ecosystem in this region
and information on how this important ecosystem can be expected to
evolve over the coming decades. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights
