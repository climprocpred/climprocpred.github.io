 abstract = {Predictability of Atlantic Ocean sea surface temperatures (SST) on    seasonal and decadal timescales is investigated using a suite of
statistical linear inverse models (LIM). Observed monthly SST anomalies
in the Atlantic sector (between 22S and 66N) are used to construct the
LIMs for seasonal and decadal prediction. The forecast skills of the
LIMs are then compared to that from two current operational forecast
systems. Results indicate that the LIM has good forecast skill for time
periods of 3-4 months on the seasonal timescale with enhanced
predictability in the spring season. On decadal timescales, the impact
of inter-annual and intra-annual variability on the predictability is
also investigated. The results show that the suite of LIMs have forecast
skill for about 3-4 years over most of the domain when we use only the
decadal variability for the construction of the LIM. Including higher
frequency variability helps improve the forecast skill and maintains the
correlation of LIM predictions with the observed SST anomalies for
longer periods. These results indicate the importance of temporal scale
interactions in improving predictability on decadal timescales. Hence,
LIMs can not only be used as benchmarks for estimates of statistical
skill but also to isolate contributions to the forecast skills from
different timescales, spatial scales or even model components.},
