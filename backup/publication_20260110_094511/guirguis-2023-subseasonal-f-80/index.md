abstract: Atmospheric rivers (ARs) and Santa Ana winds (SAWs) are impactful weather
  events for California communities. Emergency planning efforts and resource management
  would benefit from extending lead times of skillful prediction for these and other
  types of extreme weather patterns. Here we describe a methodology for subseasonal
  prediction of extreme winter weather in California, including ARs, SAWs and temperature
  extremes. The hybrid approach combines dynamical model and historical information
  to forecast probabilities of impactful weather outcomes at weeks 1-4 lead. This
  methodology (i) uses dynamical model information considered most reliable, i.e.,
  planetary/synoptic-scale atmospheric circulation, (ii) filters for dynamical model
  error/uncertainty at longer lead times, and (iii) increases the sample of likely
  outcomes by utilizing the full historical record instead of a more limited suite
  of dynamical forecast model ensemble members. We demonstrate skill above climatology
  at subseasonal timescales, highlighting potential for use in water, health, land,
  and fire management decision support.
