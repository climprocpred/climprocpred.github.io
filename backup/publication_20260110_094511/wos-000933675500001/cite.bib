 abstract = {Despite the well-recognized initial value nature of the subseasonal    forecasts, the role of subsurface ocean initialization in subseasonal
forecasts remains underexplored. Using observing system experiments,
this study investigates the impact of ocean in situ data assimilation on
the propagation of Madden-Julian Oscillation (MJO) events across the
Maritime Continent in the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather
Forecasts (ECMWF) subseasonal forecast system. Two sets of twin
experiments are analyzed, which only differ on the use or not of in situ
ocean observations in the initial conditions. Besides using the
Real-time Multivariate MJO Index (RMMI) to evaluate the forecast
performance, we also develop a new MJO tracking method based on outgoing
longwave radiation anomalies (OLRa) for forecast evaluation. We find
that the ocean initialization with in situ data assimilation, though
having an impact on the forecasted ocean mean state, does not improve
the relatively low MJO forecast skill across the Maritime Continent.
Moist static energy budget analysis further suggests that a significant
underestimation in the meridional moisture advection in the model
forecast may hinder the potential role played by the ocean state
differences associated with data assimilation. Bias of the intraseasonal
meridional winds in the model is a more important factor for such
underestimation than the mean state moisture biases. This finding
suggests that atmospheric model biases dominate the forecast error
growth, and the atmospheric circulation bias is one of the major sources
of the MJO prediction error and should be a target for improving the
ECMWF subseasonal forecast model.},
