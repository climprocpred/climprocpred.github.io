abstract: In the Bay of Bengal, the warm, dry boreal spring concludes with the    onset
  of the summer monsoon and accompanying southwesterly winds, heavy rains, and variable
  air-sea fluxes. Here, we summarize the 2018 monsoon onset using observations collected
  through the multinational Monsoon Intraseasonal Oscillations in the Bay of Bengal
  (MISO-BoB) program between the United States, India, and Sri Lanka. MISO-BoB aims
  to improve understanding of monsoon intraseasonal variability, and the 2018 field
  effort captured the coupled air-sea response during a transition from active-to-break
  conditions in the central BoB. The active phase of the similar to 20-day research
  cruise was characterized by warm sea surface temperature (SST > 30 degrees C), cold
  atmospheric outflows with intermittent heavy rainfall, and increasing winds (from
  2 to 15 m s(-1)). Accumulated rainfall exceeded 200 mm with 90% of precipitation
  occurring during the first week. The following break period was both dry and clear,
  with persistent 10-12 m s(-1) wind and evaporation of 0.2 mm h(-1). The evolving
  environmental state included a deepening ocean mixed layer (from similar to 20 to
  50 m), cooling SST (by similar to 1 degrees C), and warming/drying of the lower
  to midtroposphere. Local atmospheric development was consistent with phasing of
  the large-scale intraseasonal oscillation. The upper ocean stores significant heat
  in the BoB, enough to maintain SST above 29 degrees C despite cooling by surface
  fluxes and ocean mixing. Comparison with reanalysis indicates biases in air-sea
  fluxes, which may be related to overly cool prescribed SST. Resolution of such biases
  offers a path toward improved forecasting of transition periods in the monsoon.
