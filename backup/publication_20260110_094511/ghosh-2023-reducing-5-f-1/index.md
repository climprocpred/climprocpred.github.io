abstract: Given multi-model ensemble climate projections, the goal is to accurately
  and reliably predict future sea-level rise while lowering the uncertainty. This
  problem is important because sea-level rise affects millions of people in coastal
  communities and beyond due to climate change's impacts on polar ice sheets and the
  ocean. This problem is challenging due to spatial variability and unknowns such
  as possible tipping points (e.g., collapse of Greenland or West Antarctic ice-shelf),
  climate feedback loops (e.g., clouds, permafrost thawing), future policy decisions,
  and human actions. Most existing climate modeling approaches use the same set of
  weights globally, during either regression or deep learning to combine different
  climate projections. Such approaches are inadequate when different regions require
  different weighting schemes for accurate and reliable sea-level rise predictions.
  This paper proposes a zonal regression model which addresses spatial variability
  and model inter-dependency. Experimental results show more reliable predictions
  using the weights learned via this approach on a regional scale.
