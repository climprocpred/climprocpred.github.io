abstract: Northward propagating summer monsoon intraseasonal oscillations (MISOs)
  in the Indian Ocean region remain poorly understood and difficult to predict. Here
  we examine a free-running high-resolution regional atmospheric model (RegCM4.7 with
  25 km resolution), forced distantly at the boundaries by atmospheric observations
  (ERA-Interim, 0.75∘) and forced locally by observed sea-surface temperature (SST)
  over the period 1979–2016, to assess its ability to reproduce key aspects of these
  MISOs. We find that the model MISO exhibits spatial structures and northward propagation
  characteristics broadly similar to observed MISO when confining the analysis to
  the 25–90 day period band. The MISO precipitation anomalies are then shown to be
  consistent with previously known observed relationships to broad-scale sea-level
  pressure patterns, Inter-Tropical Convergence Zone (ITCZ) positioning, and changes
  in the regional Hadley Cell component. The total simulated seasonal (JJAS) rainfall
  anomalies over India are not significantly correlated with observations, indicating
  that intrinsic variations in the regional model atmosphere dominate most of the
  precipitation variability. However, the bandpass-filtered MISO anomalies surprisingly
  exhibit a significant correlation (0.61) with observations. This suggests that instabilities
  in the regional broad-scale atmospheric circulation, e.g., linked to the ITCZ position
  or strength, may be partly controlled by the large-scale atmospheric flows specified
  at the domain boundaries and/or that specified local SST anomalies may help to guide
  some fraction of the developing model MISO to follow observations. This result motivates
  further research on MISO initiation and development using this type of regional
  atmospheric model.
