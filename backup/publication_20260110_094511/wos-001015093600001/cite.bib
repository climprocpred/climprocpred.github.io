 abstract = {In this work, we integrated the WAVEWATCH III model into the regional    coupled model SKRIPS (Scripps-KAUST Regional Integrated Prediction
System). The WAVEWATCH III model is implemented with flexibility,
meaning the coupled system can run with or without the wave component.
In our implementations, we considered the effect of Stokes drift,
Langmuir turbulence, sea surface roughness, and wave-induced momentum
fluxes. To demonstrate the impact of coupling we performed a case study
using a series of coupled and uncoupled simulations of Tropical Cyclone
Mekunu, which occurred in the Arabian Sea in May 2018. We examined the
model skill in these simulations and further investigated the impact of
Langmuir turbulence in the coupled system. Because of the chaotic nature
of the atmosphere, we ran an ensemble of 20 members for each coupled and
uncoupled experiment. We found that the characteristics of the tropical
cyclone are not significantly different due to the effect of surface
waves when using different parameterizations, but the coupled models
better capture the minimum pressure and maximum wind speed compared with
the benchmark stand-alone Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) model.
Moreover, in the region of the cold wake, when Langmuir turbulence is
considered in the coupled system, the sea surface temperature is about
0.5 & LCIRC;C colder, and the mixed layer is about 20 m deeper. This
indicates the ocean model is sensitive to the parameterization of
Langmuir turbulence in the coupled simulations.},
