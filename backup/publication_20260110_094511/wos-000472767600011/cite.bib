 abstract = {Numerical weather prediction and climate models comprise a) a dynamical    core describing resolved parts of the climate system and b)
parameterizations describing unresolved components. Development of new
subgrid-scale parameterizations is particularly uncertain compared to
representing resolved scales in the dynamical core. This uncertainty is
currently represented by stochastic approaches in several operational
weather models, which will inevitably percolate into the dynamical core.
Hence, implementing dynamical cores with excessive numerical accuracy
will not bring forecast gains, may even hinder them since valuable
computer resources will be tied up doing insignificant computation, and
therefore cannot be deployed for more useful gains, such as increasing
model resolution or ensemble sizes. Here we describe a low-cost
stochastic scheme that can be implemented in any existing deterministic
dynamical core as an additive noise term. This scheme could be used to
adjust accuracy in future dynamical core development work. We propose
that such an additive stochastic noise test case should become a part of
the routine testing and development of dynamical cores in a stochastic
framework. The overall key point of the study is that we should not
develop dynamical cores that are more precise than the level of
uncertainty provided by our stochastic scheme. In this way, we present a
new paradigm for dynamical core development work, ensuring that weather
and climate models become more computationally efficient. We show some
results based on tests done with the European Centre for Medium-Range
Weather Forecasts (ECMWF) Integrated Forecasting System (IFS) dynamical
