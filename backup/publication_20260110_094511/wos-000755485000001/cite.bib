 abstract = {Projections of future climate are sensitive to the representation of    upper-ocean diurnal variability, including the diurnal cycle of winds.
Two different methods suitable for time series with missing data are
used here to characterize how observed diurnal winds vary over the year.
One is based on diurnal composites of mooring data, and the other is
based on harmonic analysis via a least squares fit and is able to
isolate annual (i.e., 1 cycle per year) modulation of diurnal
variability. Results show that the diurnal amplitude in meridional winds
is larger than in zonal winds and peaks in the tropical Pacific, where
diurnal variability in zonal winds is overall weaker compared to other
basins. Furthermore, the amplitude and phasing of diurnal winds in the
tropical oceans are not uniform in time, with overall larger differences
through the year in the meridional component of tropical winds.
Estimating the annual modulation of the diurnal signal implies resolving
both the diurnal energy peak and also the modulation of this peak by the
annual cycle. This leads to a recommendation for sampling at least 6
times per day and for a duration of at least 3 years.},
