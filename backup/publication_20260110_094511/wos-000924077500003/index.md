abstract: Quantifying uncertainty associated with our models is the only way we    can
  express how much we know about any phenomenon. Incomplete consideration of model-based
  uncertainties can lead to overstated conclusions with real-world impacts in diverse
  spheres, including conservation, epidemiology, climate science, and policy. Despite
  these potentially damaging consequences, we still know little about how different
  fields quantify and report uncertainty. We introduce the ``sources of uncertainty''
  framework, using it to conduct a systematic audit of model-related uncertainty quantification
  from seven scientific fields, spanning the biological, physical, and political sciences.
  Our interdisciplinary audit shows no field fully considers all possible sources
  of uncertainty, but each has its own best practices alongside shared outstanding
  challenges. We make ten easy-to-implement recommendations to improve the consistency,
  completeness, and clarity of reporting on model-related uncertainty. These recommendations
  serve as a guide to best practices across scientific fields and expand our toolbox
  for high-quality research.
