abstract: A suite of statistical linear inverse models (LIMs) are used to    understand
  the remote and local SST variability that influences SST predictions over the North
  Pacific region. Observed monthly SST anomalies in the Pacific are used to construct
  different regional LIMs for seasonal to decadal predictions. The seasonal forecast
  skills of the LIMs are compared to that from three operational forecast systems
  in the North American Multi-Model Ensemble (NMME), revealing that the LIM has better
  skill in the Northeastern Pacific than NMME models. The LIM is also found to have
  comparable forecast skill for SST in the Tropical Pacific with NMME models. This
  skill, however, is highly dependent on the initialization month, with forecasts
  initialized during the summer having better skill than those initialized during
  the winter. The data are also bandpass filtered into seasonal, interannual and decadal
  time scales to identify the relationships between time scales using the structure
  of the propagator matrix. Moreover, we investigate the influence of the tropics
  and extra-tropics in the predictability of the SST over the region. The Extratropical
  North Pacific seems to be a source of predictability for the tropics on seasonal
  to interannual time scales, while the tropics enhance the forecast skill for the
  decadal component. These results indicate the importance of temporal scale interactions
  in improving the predictions on decadal timescales. Hence, we show that LIMs are
  not only useful as benchmarks for estimates of statistical skill, but also to isolate
  contributions to the forecast skills from different timescales, spatial scales or
  even model components.
