abstract: "The most mature aspect of applying artificial intelligence (AI)/machine\
  \    learning (ML) to problems in the atmospheric sciences is likely post-processing
  of model output. This article provides some history and current state of the science
  of post-processing with AI for weather and climate models. Deriving from the discussion
  at the 2019 Oxford workshop on Machine Learning for Weather and Climate, this paper
  also presents thoughts on medium-term goals to advance such use of AI, which include
  assuring that algorithms are trustworthy and interpretable, adherence to FAIR data
  practices to promote usability, and development of techniques that leverage our
  physical knowledge of the atmosphere. The coauthors propose several actionable items
  and have initiated one of those: a repository for datasets from various real weather
  and climate problems that can be addressed using AI. Five such datasets are presented
  and permanently archived, together with Jupyter notebooks to process them and assess
  the results in comparison with a baseline technique. The coauthors invite the readers
  to test their own algorithms in comparison with the baseline and to archive their
  results. This article is part of the theme issue `Machine learning for weather and
  climate modelling'."
