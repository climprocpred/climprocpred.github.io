 abstract = {The most mature aspect of applying artificial intelligence (AI)/machine    learning (ML) to problems in the atmospheric sciences is likely
post-processing of model output. This article provides some history and
current state of the science of post-processing with AI for weather and
climate models. Deriving from the discussion at the 2019 Oxford workshop
on Machine Learning for Weather and Climate, this paper also presents
thoughts on medium-term goals to advance such use of AI, which include
assuring that algorithms are trustworthy and interpretable, adherence to
FAIR data practices to promote usability, and development of techniques
that leverage our physical knowledge of the atmosphere. The coauthors
propose several actionable items and have initiated one of those: a
repository for datasets from various real weather and climate problems
that can be addressed using AI. Five such datasets are presented and
permanently archived, together with Jupyter notebooks to process them
and assess the results in comparison with a baseline technique. The
coauthors invite the readers to test their own algorithms in comparison
with the baseline and to archive their results.
This article is part of the theme issue `Machine learning for weather
and climate modelling'.},
