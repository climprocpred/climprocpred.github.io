abstract: 'Supraglacial lakes form on the surface of the Greenland Ice Sheet during
  the summer months and can directly impact ice sheet mass balance by removing mass
  via drainage and runoff or indirectly impact mass balance by influencing ice sheet
  dynamics. Here, we utilize the growing inventory of optical and microwave satellite
  imagery to automatically determine the fate of Greenland-wide supraglacial lakes
  during 2018 and 2019, a cool and warm melt season respectively. We use a machine
  learning time series classification approach to categorize lakes into four different
  categories: lakes that 1) refreeze, 2) rapidly drain, 3) slowly drain, and 4) become
  buried lakes at the end of the melt season. We find that during the warmer 2019,
  not only was the number of lake drainage events higher than in 2018, but also the
  proportion of lakes that drained was greater. By investigating mean lake depths
  for these four categories, we show that drained lakes were, on average, 22% deeper
  than lakes that refroze or became buried lakes. Interestingly, drained lakes had
  approximately the same maximum depth in 2018 and 2019; however, lakes that did not
  drain were 29% deeper in 2018, a cooler year. Our unique two-year dataset describing
  the fate of every Greenland supraglacial lake provides novel insight into lake drainage
  and refreeze in a relatively warm and cool year, which may be increasingly relevant
  in a warming climate.'
