 abstract = {Initialized climate predictions offer distinct benefits for multiple    stakeholders. This Review discusses initialized prediction on
subseasonal to seasonal (S2S), seasonal to interannual (S2I) and
seasonal to decadal (S2D) timescales, highlighting potential for skilful
predictions in the years to come.
Initialized Earth System predictions are made by starting a numerical
prediction model in a state as consistent as possible to observations
and running it forward in time for up to 10 years. Skilful predictions
at time slices from subseasonal to seasonal (S2S), seasonal to
interannual (S2I) and seasonal to decadal (S2D) offer information useful
for various stakeholders, ranging from agriculture to water resource
management to human and infrastructure safety. In this Review, we
examine the processes influencing predictability, and discuss estimates
of skill across S2S, S2I and S2D timescales. There are encouraging signs
that skilful predictions can be made: on S2S timescales, there has been
some skill in predicting the Madden-Julian Oscillation and North
Atlantic Oscillation; on S2I, in predicting the El Nino-Southern
Oscillation; and on S2D, in predicting ocean and atmosphere variability
in the North Atlantic region. However, challenges remain, and future
work must prioritize reducing model error, more effectively
communicating forecasts to users, and increasing process and mechanistic
understanding that could enhance predictive skill and, in turn,
confidence. As numerical models progress towards Earth System models,
initialized predictions are expanding to include prediction of sea ice,
air pollution, and terrestrial and ocean biochemistry that can bring
clear benefit to society and various stakeholders.},
