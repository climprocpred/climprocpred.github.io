abstract: The effect of polar sea ice melt on low latitude climate is little    known.
  To understand the response of the Indian summer monsoon (ISM) synoptic activity
  to the sea ice melt, we have run a suite of coupled and uncoupled climate model
  simulations. In one set of simulations, the albedo of sea ice is reduced so that
  it would melt due to increased absorption of solar radiation. The coupled model
  simulation with a reduced sea ice albedo resulted in an almost complete melting
  of the sea ice in summer in both hemispheres. A high-resolution (50 km) atmospheric
  general circulation model (AGCM) is forced with the climatological annual cycles
  of sea surface temperature (SST) and sea ice concentrations (SIC) from the coupled
  model outputs to better resolve synoptic scale variability. In the high-resolution
  AGCM simulations forced with SST and SIC from the sea ice melt experiments, the
  ISM circulation weakened substantially, and the monsoon low-pressure systems (LPS)
  activity experienced an overall decline of 23%, with a widespread weakening in the
  south and a moderate strengthening over the north, in response to a decline of 78
  % (24 %) in SIC over the Arctic (Antarctic) in the June-September season. The changes
  in the LPS activity in response to polar sea ice melt are found to be mostly driven
  by the changes in low-level absolute vorticity and vertical shear over the Bay of
  Bengal. Plain Language Summary The sea ice is melting rapidly in a warming climate,
  which can have feedback effects on the climate system. However, the impact of sea
  ice melt on low latitude climate is not adequately understood. The Indian summer
  monsoon (ISM), known as the lifeline of South Asia, is essential to the water security
  of more than 1.5 billion people. We examined the response of the ISM to the polar
  sea ice melt using a suite of global climate model experiments. Our simulations
  show that the monsoon circulation and rainfall weaken substantially due to the sea
  ice melt. Further, the number of propagating precipitating vortices embedded in
  the monsoon circulation declined by about 22 % in the sea ice melt experiments.
  Our results suggest that the Arctic and Antarctic sea ice melt could have severe
  implications for the water security of South Asia.
