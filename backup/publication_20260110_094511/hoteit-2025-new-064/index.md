abstract: The desert climate of the Arabian Peninsula (AP), marked by sparse rainfall,
  extreme temperatures, and frequent dust events, significantly impacts its 80‐million
  population, environment, and economy. Rising temperatures and dust incursions exacerbate
  these harsh conditions, yet the AP's climate is underrepresented in global climate
  research. Understanding its variability is crucial for improving predictions on
  subseasonal‐to‐seasonal timescales and for developing reliable climate change projections.
  Existing climate models fail to capture the region's unique environment, topography,
  and land‐use changes, leading to poor representation of key processes like local
  convection, aridity, and moisture transport. To address these gaps, Saudi Arabia
  established the Climate Change Center (CCC) in 2022, part of the Saudi Vision 2030
  initiative. The CCC aims to study climate variability and project future changes
  using advanced Earth system models developed in collaboration with international
  partners. This study presents the CCC's roadmap, focusing on its relevance for global
  climate research and policymaking, including the Saudi and Middle East Green Initiatives.
  We also discuss regional uncertainties in the IPCC's climate projections for the
  AP and highlight the development of high‐resolution regional models that account
  for local atmospheric, land, and oceanic processes. The CCC is developing subseasonal‐to‐seasonal
  forecasting systems and drought monitoring tools, alongside user‐friendly dashboards
  to offer stakeholders customized climate data. These tools, set for launch in 2025,
  will aid informed decision‐making in addressing extreme weather events and climate‐related
  challenges in Saudi Arabia. The Arabian Peninsula (AP) has a very dry desert climate
  with little rainfall, extremely high temperatures, and frequent dust storms affect
  the lives of over 80 million people in the region. As climate change makes things
  worse—like rising temperatures and more dust—it's important to understand how the
  climate works here and how it may change in the future. However, most global climate
  studies don't focus much on this region. Large‐scale climate models also struggle
  to capture the AP's unique features, such as its deserts, mountains, and coastal
  areas. To address this, Saudi Arabia started the Climate Change Center (CCC) in
  2022 as part of Vision 2030. In this study, we detail the CCC's goals to study the
  region's climate, improve predictions for the future using advanced climate models,
  develop tools for seasonal forecasting and drought monitoring, and create easy‐to‐use
  dashboards that will let people access climate data. These tools, launching in 2025,
  will help decision‐makers in Saudi Arabia tackle problems like extreme weather,
  rising sea levels, and planning for greener and more sustainable cities. This study
  presents a Climate Change Center as a hub for research, data, and forecasting, supporting
  adaptation and sustainability The center will develop a climate database, models,
  and forecasts to improve climate projections and weather predictions for the Arabian
  Peninsula It will assess extreme weather impacts and provide a climate portal for
  stakeholders, policymakers, and the public to access key data This study presents
