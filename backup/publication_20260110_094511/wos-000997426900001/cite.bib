 abstract = {Modern climate models use both deterministic and stochastic    parametrization schemes to represent uncertainties in their physics and
inputs. This work considers the problem of estimating the involved
parameters of such systems simultaneously with their state through data
assimilation. Standard state-parameter filtering schemes cannot be
applied to such systems, owing to the posterior dependence between the
stochastic parameters and the ``dynamical'' augmented state, defined
as the state augmented by the deterministic parameters. We resort to the
variational Bayesian (VB) approach to break this dependence, by
approximating the joint posterior probability density function (pdf) of
the augmented state and the stochastic parameters with a separable
product of two marginal pdfs that minimizes the Kullback-Leibler
divergence. The resulting marginal pdf of the augmented state is then
sampled using a one-step-ahead smoothing-based ensemble Kalman filter
(EnKF-OSAS), whereas a closed form is derived for the marginal pdf of
the stochastic parameters. The proposed approach combines the
effectiveness of the OSAS filtering approach to mitigate inconsistency
issues that often arise with the joint ensemble Kalman filter (EnKF),
with the advantage of obtaining a full posterior pdf for the stochastic
parameters, which is not possible with the traditional
maximum-likelihood method. We demonstrate the relevance of the proposed
approach through extensive numerical experiments with a one-scale
Lorenz-96 model, which includes a stochastic parametrization
representing subgrid-scale effects.},
