 abstract = {Tropical sea surface temperature (SST) and winds vary on a wide range of    timescales and have a substantial impact on weather and climate across
the globe. Here we study the variability of SST and zonal wind during El
Nino-Southern Oscillation (ENSO) between 1982 and 2014. We focus on
changes in extreme statistics using higher-order moments of SST and
zonal winds. We find that ENSO characteristics exhibit bimodal
distributions and fat tails with extreme warm and cold temperatures in
1982-1999, but not during 2000-2014. The changes in the distributions
coincide with changes in the intensity of ENSO events and the phase of
the Interdecadal Pacific Oscillation. We also find that the strongest
Easterly Wind Bursts occur during extreme El Ninos and not during La
Ninas. Maps of SST kurtosis can serve as a diagnostic for the
thermocline feedback mechanism responsible for the differences in ENSO
diversity between the two periods.
Plain Language Summary El Nino and La Nina in the Tropical Pacific Ocean
affect weather, water resources, and fragile ecosystems around the
globe. These phenomena have been extensively studied, yet we know
relatively little on how and why El Nino and La Nina have changed over
the past several decades. We use observational data sets of the ocean
temperature and atmospheric winds to quantify and understand the nature
of the change in these phenomena. We show that extreme El Nino and La
Nina events occur more often in the 1980s and 1990s while in the past
two decades there have been fewer extreme events in the Tropical
Pacific. We also find that the strongest easterly wind anomalies occur
during the extreme El Nino years only, which can then change how the
atmosphere and ocean interact during these events compared to more
moderate warm events. The Interdecadal Pacific Oscillation appears to
modulate the decadal changes in the extremes of these events.},
