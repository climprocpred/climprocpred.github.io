 abstract = {Waves generated by tropical cyclones can have devastating effects on    coastal regions. However, the role of ocean currents in modifying wave
amplitudes, wavelengths, and directions is commonly overlooked in wave
forecasts, despite the fact that these interactions can lead to extreme
wave conditions. Here, we use satellite observations and wave modeling
to quantify the effects of ocean currents on the surface waves generated
during a tropical cyclone event in the Arabian Sea. As a case study,
this paper documents beams of wave heights originating from the eye-wall
of a tropical cyclone caused by current-induced refraction. Alternating
regions of high and low wave heights in the model simulations are
consistent with observations and extend for thousands of kilometers all
the way to 100 m isobath. Our results highlight the importance of
accounting for wave refraction by currents in order to accurately
predict the impact of tropical cyclone generated waves on coastal
regions.
Plain Language Summary Waves generated by tropical cyclones can have
devastating effects on coastal regions. Ocean currents can modify wave
heights and lead to extreme wave conditions. Here, we use satellite
observations and wave modeling to quantify the effects of ocean currents
on the waves during a tropical cyclone event in the Arabian Sea. In this
paper, we documented the coherent beams of wave heights originating from
the ``center'' of a tropical cyclone caused by current-induced
effects. Alternating regions of high and low wave heights in the model
simulations are consistent with observations and extend for thousands of
kilometers all the way to 100 m isobath. Our results highlight the
importance of accounting for the currents in order to accurately predict
the impact of tropical cyclone generated waves on coastal regions.},
