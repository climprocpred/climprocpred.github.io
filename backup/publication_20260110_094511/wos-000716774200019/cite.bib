 abstract = {Landfalling atmospheric rivers (ARs) over the western US are responsible    for similar to 30%-50\ % of the annual precipitation, and their accurate
forecasts are essential for aiding water management decisions and
reducing flood risks. Sparse coverage of conventional observations over
the Pacific Ocean, which can cause inadequate upstream initial
conditions for numerical weather prediction models, may limit the
improvement of forecast skill for these events. A targeted field program
called AR Reconnaissance (Recon) was initiated in 2016 to better
understand and reduce forecast errors of landfalling ARs at 1-5 days
lead times. During the winter seasons of 2016, 2018, and 2019, 15
Intensive Observation Periods (IOPs) sampled the upstream conditions for
landfalling ARs. This study evaluates the impact on forecast accuracy of
assimilating these dropsonde data. Data denial experiments with
(WithDROP) and without (NoDROP) dropsonde data were conducted using the
Weather Research and Forecasting model with the Gridpoint Statistical
Interpolation four-dimensional ensemble variational system. Comparisons
between the 15 paired NoDROP and WithDROP experiments demonstrate that
AR Recon dropsondes reduced the root-mean-square error in integrated
vapor transport (IVT) and inland precipitation for more than 70\ % of the
IOPs, averaged over all forecast lead times from 1 to 6 days. Dropsondes
have improved the spatial pattern of forecasts of IVT and precipitation
in all 15 IOPs. Significant improvements in skill are found beyond the
short range (1-2 days). IOP sequences (i.e., back-to-back IOPs every
other day) show the most improvement of inland precipitation forecast
skill.},
