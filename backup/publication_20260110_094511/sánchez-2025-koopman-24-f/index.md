abstract: El Ni&#241;o-Southern Oscillation (ENSO) is a complex climatic phenomenon
  with significant impacts on global weather patterns and ecosystems. Improving ENSO
  predictability is therefore an issue of high societal value. However, Global Circulation
  Models present severe biases when predicting ENSO, and their skill remains comparable
  to that of vastly simpler empirical models such as Linear Inverse Models (LIMs).
  LIMs, however, rely on linear dynamics, and they have inherent limitations in capturing
  the behavior of non-linear phenomena. In this context, Koopman operator theory has
  emerged as a powerful mathematical framework, offering a novel perspective for analyzing
  complex non-linear systems, such as ENSO. In this study, we investigate the potential
  of Koopman operator theory to enhance ENSO forecasting accuracy. Leveraging 2000
  years of tropical SST pre-industrial CESM data, we have assessed the skill of the
  Ni&#241;o 3.4 index forecasts using the Koopman framework, and compared it to the
  benchmark set by LIMs. Our analysis includes sensitivity testing of both methods
  across various parameters, such as retained variability and data length used for
  operator computations. Our findings reveal nuances in the robustness of Koopman
  Operator estimates, particularly evident when using shorter training periods, contrasting
  with more stable LIM counterparts. However, a notable breakthrough emerges as we
  demonstrate the higher skill of Koopman multimodel ensembles, showcasing consistent
  improvements over linear models. The comparative analysis highlights the potential
  of Koopman operator theory in advancing ENSO forecasting beyond linear models. The
  utilization of Koopman multimodel ensembles emerges as a promising strategy, demonstrating
  enhanced forecasting capabilities. Yet, challenges in robustness persist, particularly
  in shorter data spans, signaling avenues for further refinement. Overall, these
  findings underscore the significance of the Koopman framework and lay the groundwork
  for future research aimed at refining methodologies for more accurate predictions
  in complex climatic systems.
