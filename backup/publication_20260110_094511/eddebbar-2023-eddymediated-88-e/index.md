abstract: In the tropical Pacific, weak ventilation and intense microbial respiration
  at depth give rise to a low dissolved oxygen (O2) environment that is thought to
  be ventilated primarily by the equatorial current system (ECS). The role of mesoscale
  eddies and diapycnal mixing as potential pathways of O2 supply in this region, however,
  remains poorly known due to sparse observations and coarse model resolution. Using
  an eddy resolving simulation of ocean circulation and biogeochemistry, we assess
  the contribution of these processes to the O2 budget balance and find that turbulent
  mixing of O2 and its modulation by mesoscale eddies contribute substantially to
  the replenishment of O2 in the upper equatorial Pacific thermocline, complementing
  the advective supply of O2 by the ECS and meridional circulation at depth. These
  transport processes are strongly sensitive to seasonal forcing by the wind, with
  elevated mixing of O2 into the upper thermocline during summer and fall when the
  vertical shear of the lateral flow and eddy kinetic energy are intensified. The
  tight link between eddy activity and the downward mixing of O2 arises from the modulation
  of equatorial turbulence by Tropical Instability Waves via their eddy impacts on
  the vertical shear. This interaction of ocean processes across scales sustains a
  local pathway of O2 delivery into the equatorial Pacific interior and highlights
  the need for adequate observations and model representation of turbulent mixing
  and mesoscale processes for understanding and predicting the fate of the tropical
  Pacific O2 content in a warmer and more stratified ocean.
