abstract: We use a stochastic differential equation (SDE) model with a random    precipitation
  trigger for mass balance to simulate the 20 s temporal resolution column precipitable
  water vapor (PWV) data during the tropical warm pool international cloud experiment
  (TWP-ICE) period of January 20 to February 15, 2006 at Darwin, Australia. The trigger
  is determined by an exponential cumulative distribution function, the time step
  size in the SDE simulation, and a random precipitation indicator uniformly distributed
  over [0, 1]. Compared with the observed data, the simulations have similar means,
  extremes, skewness, kurtosis, and overall shapes of probability distribution, and
  are temporally well synchronized for increasing and decreasing, but have about 20%
  lower standard deviation. Based on a 1000-day run, the correlations between the
  model data and theobservations in TWP-ICE period were computed in a moving time
  window of 25 days and show quasi-periodic variations between (-0.675, 0.697). This
  shows that the results are robust for the stochastic model simulation of the observed
  PWV data, whose fractal dimension is 1.9, while the dimension of the simulated data
  is also about 1.9. This agreement and numerous sensitivity experiments form a test
  on the feasibility of using an SDE model to simulate precipitation processes in
  more complex climate models.
