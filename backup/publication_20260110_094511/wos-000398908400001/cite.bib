 abstract = {We use a stochastic differential equation (SDE) model with a random    precipitation trigger for mass balance to simulate the 20 s temporal
resolution column precipitable water vapor (PWV) data during the
tropical warm pool international cloud experiment (TWP-ICE) period of
January 20 to February 15, 2006 at Darwin, Australia. The trigger is
determined by an exponential cumulative distribution function, the time
step size in the SDE simulation, and a random precipitation indicator
uniformly distributed over [0, 1]. Compared with the observed data,
the simulations have similar means, extremes, skewness, kurtosis, and
overall shapes of probability distribution, and are temporally well
synchronized for increasing and decreasing, but have about 20% lower
standard deviation. Based on a 1000-day run, the correlations between
the model data and theobservations in TWP-ICE period were computed in a
moving time window of 25 days and show quasi-periodic variations between
(-0.675, 0.697). This shows that the results are robust for the
stochastic model simulation of the observed PWV data, whose fractal
dimension is 1.9, while the dimension of the simulated data is also
about 1.9. This agreement and numerous sensitivity experiments form a
test on the feasibility of using an SDE model to simulate precipitation
processes in more complex climate models.},
