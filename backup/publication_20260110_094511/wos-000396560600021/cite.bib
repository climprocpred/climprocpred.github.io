 abstract = {Uncertainties in parametrized processes in general circulation models    can be represented as stochastic perturbations to the model formulation.
The European Centre for MediumRange Weather Forecasts (ECMWF) has
pioneered approaches to represent these model errors in forecasting
systems. In particular, the stochastically perturbed physical tendency
(SPPT) scheme for the atmosphere is used in their operational ensemble
system for mediumand long-range predictions. Recent studies have shown
that these stochastic approaches can both increase the reliability of
the probabilistic forecasts and reduce long-term mean biases of themodel
climate. Towards developing a seamless prediction system in the future,
these benefits of stochastic parametrization for both short-term and
long-term forecasts make it an essential component of the next
generation Earth System models. We present results of the impact of
different configurations of the SPPT scheme in ECMWF's seasonal
forecasting System 4 on the mean and variability in tropical
precipitation. Small-scale perturbations in the SPPT scheme play a
significant role in reducing the mean biases in tropical precipitation.
The stochastic physics also nonlinearly rectify the convection and
precipitation during different phases of El Nino Southern Oscillation
events and improve the reliability of the ensemble forecasts for the
Madden-Julian Oscillation (MJO). They impact the MJO dynamics by
modulating the convective and suppressed phases of the MJO. Finally, we
discuss some of the caveats to this analysis and some future prospects.},
