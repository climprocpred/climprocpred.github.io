 abstract = {Ocean surface winds, currents, and waves play a crucial role in    exchanges of momentum, energy, heat, freshwater, gases, and other
tracers between the ocean, atmosphere, and ice. Despite surface waves
being strongly coupled to the upper ocean circulation and the overlying
atmosphere, efforts to improve ocean, atmospheric, and wave observations
and models have evolved somewhat independently. From an observational
point of view, community efforts to bridge this gap have led to
proposals for satellite Doppler oceanography mission concepts, which
could provide unprecedented measurements of absolute surface velocity
and directional wave spectrum at global scales. This paper reviews the
present state of observations of surface winds, currents, and waves, and
it outlines observational gaps that limit our current understanding of
coupled processes that happen at the air-sea-ice interface. A
significant challenge for the coming decade of wind, current, and wave
observations will come in combining and interpreting measurements from
(a) wave-buoys and high-frequency radars in coastal regions, (b) surface
drifters and wave-enabled drifters in the open-ocean, marginal ice
zones, and wave-current interaction ``hot-spots,'' and (c)
simultaneous measurements of absolute surface currents, ocean surface
wind vector, and directional wave spectrum from Doppler satellite
sensors.},
