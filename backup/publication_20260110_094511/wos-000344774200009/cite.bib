 abstract = {This study quantifies, from a systematic set of regional    ocean-atmosphere coupled model simulations employing various coupling
intervals, the effect of subdaily sea surface temperature (SST)
variability on the onset and intensity of Madden-Julian oscillation
(MJO) convection in the Indian Ocean. The primary effect of diurnal SST
variation (dSST) is to raise time-mean SST and latent heat flux (LH)
prior to deep convection. Diurnal SST variation also strengthens the
diurnal moistening of the troposphere by collocating the diurnal peak in
LH with those of SST. Both effects enhance the convection such that the
total precipitation amount scales quasi-linearly with preconvection dSST
and time-mean SST. A column-integrated moist static energy (MSE) budget
analysis confirms the critical role of diurnal SST variability in the
buildup of column MSE and the strength of MJO convection via stronger
time-mean LH and diurnal moistening. Two complementary atmosphere-only
simulations further elucidate the role of SST conditions in the
predictive skill of MJO. The atmospheric model forced with the
persistent initial SST, lacking enhanced preconvection warming and
moistening, produces a weaker and delayed convection than the diurnally
coupled run. The atmospheric model with prescribed daily-mean SST from
the coupled run, while eliminating the delayed peak, continues to
exhibit weaker convection due to the lack of strong moistening on a
diurnal basis. The fact that time-evolving SST with a diurnal cycle
strongly influences the onset and intensity of MJO convection is
consistent with previous studies that identified an improved
representation of diurnal SST as a potential source of MJO
predictability.},
