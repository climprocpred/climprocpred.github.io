abstract: "Atmospheric rivers (ARs) play a key role in California's water supply \
  \   and are responsible for most of the extreme precipitation and major flooding
  along the west coast of North America. Given the high societal impact, it is critical
  to improve our understanding and prediction of ARs. This study uses a regional coupled
  ocean-atmosphere modeling system to make hindcasts of ARs up to 14 days. Two groups
  of coupled runs are highlighted in the comparison: (1) ARs occurring during times
  with strong sea surface temperature (SST) cooling and (2) ARs occurring during times
  with weak SST cooling. During the events with strong SST cooling, the coupled model
  simulates strong upward air-sea heat fluxes associated with ARs; on the other hand,
  when the SST cooling is weak, the coupled model simulates downward air-sea heat
  fluxes in the AR region. Validation data shows that the coupled model skillfully
  reproduces the evolving SST, as well as the surface turbulent heat transfers between
  the ocean and atmosphere. The roles of air-sea interactions in AR events are investigated
  by comparing coupled model hindcasts to hindcasts made using persistent SST. To
  evaluate the influence of the ocean on ARs we analyze two representative variables
  of AR intensity, the vertically integrated water vapor (IWV) and integrated vapor
  transport (IVT). During strong SST cooling AR events the simulated IWV is improved
  by about 12% in the coupled run at lead times greater than one week. For IVT, which
  is about twice more variable, the improvement in the coupled run is about 5 %. Plain
  Language Summary Atmospheric rivers (ARs) play a key role in extreme precipitation
  along the west coast of North America. Because of their important societal impact,
  an improved understanding of ARs is critical. In the present work, we use a coupled
  ocean-atmosphere modeling system to investigate the role of air-sea interactions
  in simulating ARs. We highlight two groups in our simulations for which the ocean's
  response to ARs differs. One group is associated with strong ocean cooling, where
  the ocean cools everywhere. The other group is associated with weak ocean cooling,
  where the ARs can warm part of the ocean. We investigate the AR water vapor content
  and transport to evaluate the ocean's impact on ARs. We find that the coupled model
  better simulates the air-sea exchanges and AR water vapor content. The improvements
  are more significant during the AR events associated with strong ocean cooling."
