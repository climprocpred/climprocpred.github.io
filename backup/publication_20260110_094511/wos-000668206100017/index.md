abstract: Using a high-resolution atmospheric general circulation model simulation    of
  unprecedented ensemble size, we examine potential predictability of monthly anomalies
  under El Nino-Southern Oscillation (ENSO) forcing and background internal variability.
  This study reveals the pronounced month-to-month evolution of both the ENSO forcing
  signal and internal variability. Internal variance in upper-level geopotential height
  decreases (similar to 10%) over the North Pacific during El Nino as the westerly
  jet extends eastward, allowing forced signals to account for a greater fraction
  of the total variability, and leading to increased potential predictability. We
  identify February and March of El Nino years as the most predictable months using
  a signal-to-noise analysis. In contrast, December, a month typically included in
  teleconnection studies, shows little to no potential predictability. We show that
  the seasonal evolution of SST forcing and variability leads to significant signal-to-noise
  relationships that can be directly linked to both upper-level and surface variable
  predictability for a given month. The stark changes in forced response, internal
  variability, and thus signal-to-noise across an ENSO season indicate that subseasonal
  fields should be used to diagnose potential predictability over North America associated
  with ENSO teleconnections. Using surface air temperature and precipitation as examples,
  this study provides motivation to pursue ``windows of forecast opportunity'' in
  which statistical skill can be developed, tested, and leveraged to determine times
  and regions in which this skill may be elevated.
