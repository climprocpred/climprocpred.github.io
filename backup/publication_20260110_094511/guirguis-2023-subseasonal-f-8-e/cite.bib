 abstract = {Atmospheric rivers (ARs) and Santa Ana winds (SAWs) are impactful weather events for California communities. Emergency planning efforts and resource management would benefit from extending lead times of skillful prediction for these and other types of extreme weather patterns. Here we describe a methodology for subseasonal prediction of extreme winter weather in California, including ARs, SAWs and temperature extremes. The hybrid approach combines dynamical model and historical information to forecast probabilities of impactful weather outcomes at weeks 1-4 lead. This methodology (i) uses dynamical model information considered most reliable, i.e., planetary/synoptic-scale atmospheric circulation, (ii) filters for dynamical model error/uncertainty at longer lead times, and (iii) increases the sample of likely outcomes by utilizing the full historical record instead of a more limited suite of dynamical forecast model ensemble members. We demonstrate skill above climatology at subseasonal timescales, highlighting potential for use in water, health, land, and fire management decision support.},
