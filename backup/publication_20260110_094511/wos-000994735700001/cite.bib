 abstract = {The Sierra Nevada and Southern Cascades-California's snowy mountains-are    primary freshwater sources and natural reservoirs for the states of
California and Nevada. These mountains receive precipitation
overwhelmingly from wintertime storms including atmospheric rivers
(ARs), much of it falling as snow at the higher elevations. Using a
seven-decade record of daily observed temperature and precipitation as
well as a snow reanalysis and downscaled climate projections, we
documented historical and future changes in snow accumulation and
snowlines. In four key subregions of California's snowy mountains, we
quantified the progressing contribution of ARs and non-AR storms to the
evolving and projected snow accumulation and snowlines (elevation of the
snow-to-rain transition), exploring their climatology, variability and
trends. Historically, snow makes up roughly a third of the precipitation
affecting California's mountains. While ARs make up only a quarter of
all precipitating days and, due to their relative warmth, produce
snowlines higher than do other storms, they contribute over 40% of the
total seasonal snow. Under projected unabated warming, snow accumulation
would decline to less than half of historical by the late twenty-first
century, with the greatest snow loss at mid elevations (from 1500 to
3300 m by the mountain sub-regions) during fall and spring. Central and
Southern Sierra Nevada peaks above 3400 m might see occasionally extreme
snow accumulations in January-February resulting entirely from wetter
ARs. AR-related snowlines are projected to increase by more than 700 m,
compared to about 500 m for other storms. We discuss likely impacts of
the changing climate for water resources as well as for winter
recreation.},
