abstract: This study examines the effect of surface current in the bulk formula    for
  the wind stress, referred to as the relative wind (RW) effect, on the energetics
  of the geostrophic circulation and the upper ocean stratification in the Bay of
  Bengal (BoB) during the summer monsoon seasons. When the RW effect is taken into
  account in the high-resolution SCOAR (WRF-ROMS) regional coupled model simulation
  and compared to the run without such a consideration, the kinetic energy both in
  the mean (MICE) and eddy (EKE) is reduced by more than a factor of two. The most
  significant reduction in the kinetic energy is found along the path of the northward
  East India Coastal Current (EICC) and to the south of its separated latitude. The
  energetics calculations and spectral analysis reveal that this significant damping
  of EKE is primarily due to reduced eddy wind work principally at wavelengths close
  to the first baroclinic Rossby deformation radius, indicating the modulation of
  the wind work by geostrophic mesoscale eddy fields. Moreover, the mixed layer depth
  (MLD) is significantly shoaled south of the separated EICC latitude, the area dominated
  by anticyclonic eddy activity. The shallower mixed layer and enhanced stratification
  with the RW effect are attributed to doming of the isopycnals by the anomalous upward
  Ekman velocity, which itself is generated by the interaction of anticyclonic mesoscale
  surface current and the prevailing southwesterly monsoonal wind. Overall, the geostrophic
  circulation and upper ocean stratification along the EICC and south of its separated
  latitude exhibit the most significant dynamical response. This result implies that
  this southwestern part of the BoB is a hot spot for the momentum exchange between
  the surface circulation and the monsoonal winds, thus a potential area for focused
  field measurements for the ocean circulation energetics and air-sea interaction.
