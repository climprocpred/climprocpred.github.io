 abstract = {A new prototype coupled ocean-atmosphere Ensemble Kalman Filter    reanalysis product, the Community Earth System Model using the Data
Assimilation Research Testbed (CESM-DART), is studied by comparing its
tropical climate variability to other reanalysis products, available
observations, and a free-running version of the model. The results
reveal that CESM-DART produces fields that are comparable in overall
performance with those of four other uncoupled and coupled reanalyses.
The clearest signature of differences in CESM-DART is in the analysis of
the Madden-Julian Oscillation (MJO) and other tropical atmospheric
waves. MJO energy is enhanced over the free-running CESM as well as
compared to the other products, suggesting the importance of the surface
flux coupling at the ocean-atmosphere interface in organizing convective
activity. In addition, high-frequency Kelvin waves in CESM-DART are
reduced in amplitude compared to the free-running CESM run and the other
products, again supportive of the oceanic coupling playing a role in
this difference. CESM-DART also exhibits a relatively low bias in the
mean tropical precipitation field and mean sensible heat flux field.
Conclusive evidence of the importance of coupling on data assimilation
performance will require additional detailed direct comparisons with
identically formulated, uncoupled data assimilation runs.},
