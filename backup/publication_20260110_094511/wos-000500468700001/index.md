abstract: A new prototype coupled ocean-atmosphere Ensemble Kalman Filter    reanalysis
  product, the Community Earth System Model using the Data Assimilation Research Testbed
  (CESM-DART), is studied by comparing its tropical climate variability to other reanalysis
  products, available observations, and a free-running version of the model. The results
  reveal that CESM-DART produces fields that are comparable in overall performance
  with those of four other uncoupled and coupled reanalyses. The clearest signature
  of differences in CESM-DART is in the analysis of the Madden-Julian Oscillation
  (MJO) and other tropical atmospheric waves. MJO energy is enhanced over the free-running
  CESM as well as compared to the other products, suggesting the importance of the
  surface flux coupling at the ocean-atmosphere interface in organizing convective
  activity. In addition, high-frequency Kelvin waves in CESM-DART are reduced in amplitude
  compared to the free-running CESM run and the other products, again supportive of
  the oceanic coupling playing a role in this difference. CESM-DART also exhibits
  a relatively low bias in the mean tropical precipitation field and mean sensible
  heat flux field. Conclusive evidence of the importance of coupling on data assimilation
  performance will require additional detailed direct comparisons with identically
  formulated, uncoupled data assimilation runs.
