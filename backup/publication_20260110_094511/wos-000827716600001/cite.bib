 abstract = {Floods caused by atmospheric rivers and wildfires fanned by Santa Ana    winds are common occurrences in California with devastating societal
impacts. In this work, we show that winter weather variability in
California, including the occurrence of extreme and impactful events, is
linked to four atmospheric circulation regimes over the North Pacific
Ocean previously named and identified as the ``NP4 modes''. These
modes come in and out of phase with each other during the season,
resulting in distinct weather patterns that recur throughout the
historical record. Some phase combinations favor atmospheric river
landfalls and extreme daily or multi-day precipitation, while other
phase combinations favor anomalously hot weather and drying Santa Ana
wind conditions over Southern California. This historical perspective of
atmospheric circulation and impacts over 70 years reveals that weather
patterns are changing in a way that enhances wildfire hazard in
California, while the frequency of weather patterns linked to historical
floods is not diminishing. These changes highlight the rising hazards of
cascading weather extremes in California's present and future.},
