 abstract = {Water management and flood control are major challenges in the western    United States. They are heavily influenced by atmospheric river (AR)
storms that produce both beneficial water supply and hazards; for
example, 84% of all flood damages in the West (up to 99\ % in key areas)
are associated with ARs. However, AR landfall forecast position errors
can exceed 200 km at even 1-day lead time and yet many watersheds are
<100 km across, which contributes to issues such as the 2017 Oroville
Dam spillway incident and regularly to large flood forecast errors.
Combined with the rise of wildfires and deadly post-wildfire debris
flows, such as Montecito (2018), the need for better AR forecasts is
urgent. Atmospheric River Reconnaissance (AR Recon) was developed as a
research and operations partnership to address these needs. It combines
new observations, modeling, data assimilation, and forecast verification
methods to improve the science and predictions of landfalling ARs. ARs
over the northeast Pacific are measured using dropsondes from up to
three aircraft simultaneously. Additionally, airborne radio occultation
is being tested, and drifting buoys with pressure sensors are deployed.
AR targeting and data collection methods have been developed,
assimilation and forecast impact experiments are ongoing, and better
understanding of AR dynamics is emerging. AR Recon is led by the Center
for Western Weather and Water Extremes and NWS/NCEP. The effort's core
partners include the U.S. Navy, U.S. Air Force, NCAR, ECMWF, and
multiple academic institutions. AR Recon is included in the ``National
Winter Season Operations Plan'' to support improved outcomes for
emergency preparedness and water management in the West.},
