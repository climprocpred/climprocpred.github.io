abstract: 'A multimodel evaluation of subseasonal-to-seasonal (S2S) hindcast skill    of
  atmospheric rivers (ARs) out to 4-week lead over the western United States is presented
  for three operational hindcast systems: European Centre for Medium-Range Weather
  Forecasts (ECMWF; Europe), National Centers for Environmental Prediction (NCEP;
  U.S.), and Environment and Canada Climate Change (ECCC; Canada). Ensemble mean biases
  and Brier Skill Scores are examined for no, moderate, and high levels of AR activity
  (0, 1-2, and 3-7 AR days/week, respectively). All hindcast systems are more skillful
  in predicting no and high AR activity relative to moderate activity. There are isolated
  regions of skill at week-3 over 150-125 degrees W, 25-35 degrees N for the no and
  high AR activity levels, with larger magnitude and spatial extent of the skill in
  ECMWF and ECCC compared to NCEP. The spatial pattern of this skill suggests that
  for high AR activity, a southwest-to-northeast orientation is more predictable at
  subseasonal lead times than other orientations, and for no AR activity, more skill
  exists in the subtropical North Pacific, upstream of central and southern California.
  AR hindcast skill along the western U.S. is most strongly increased in hindcasts
  initialized during MaddenJulian Oscillation (MJO) Phases 1 and 8, and hindcast skill
  is substantially decreased over California in hindcasts initialized during MJO Phase
  4. Skill modulations in the ECMWF hindcast system conditioned on El Nino-Southern
  Oscillation phase are weaker than those conditioned on particular MJO phases. This
  work provides hindcast skill benchmarks and uncertainty quantification for experimental
  real-time forecasts of AR activity during winters 2019-2021 as part of the S2S Prediction
  Project Real-time Pilot Initiative in collaboration with the California Department
  of Water Resources.'
