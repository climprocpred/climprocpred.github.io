 abstract = {A multimodel evaluation of subseasonal-to-seasonal (S2S) hindcast skill    of atmospheric rivers (ARs) out to 4-week lead over the western United
States is presented for three operational hindcast systems: European
Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF; Europe), National
Centers for Environmental Prediction (NCEP; U.S.), and Environment and
Canada Climate Change (ECCC; Canada). Ensemble mean biases and Brier
Skill Scores are examined for no, moderate, and high levels of AR
activity (0, 1-2, and 3-7 AR days/week, respectively). All hindcast
systems are more skillful in predicting no and high AR activity relative
to moderate activity. There are isolated regions of skill at week-3 over
150-125 degrees W, 25-35 degrees N for the no and high AR activity
levels, with larger magnitude and spatial extent of the skill in ECMWF
and ECCC compared to NCEP. The spatial pattern of this skill suggests
that for high AR activity, a southwest-to-northeast orientation is more
predictable at subseasonal lead times than other orientations, and for
no AR activity, more skill exists in the subtropical North Pacific,
upstream of central and southern California. AR hindcast skill along the
western U.S. is most strongly increased in hindcasts initialized during
MaddenJulian Oscillation (MJO) Phases 1 and 8, and hindcast skill is
substantially decreased over California in hindcasts initialized during
MJO Phase 4. Skill modulations in the ECMWF hindcast system conditioned
on El Nino-Southern Oscillation phase are weaker than those conditioned
on particular MJO phases. This work provides hindcast skill benchmarks
and uncertainty quantification for experimental real-time forecasts of
AR activity during winters 2019-2021 as part of the S2S Prediction
Project Real-time Pilot Initiative in collaboration with the California
Department of Water Resources.},
