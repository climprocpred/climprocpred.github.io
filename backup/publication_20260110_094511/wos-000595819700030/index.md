abstract: The latest generation of coupled models, the sixth Coupled Models    Intercomparison
  Project (CMIP6), is used to study the changes in the El Nino-Southern Oscillation
  (ENSO) in a warming climate. For the four future scenarios studied, the sea surface
  temperature variability increases in most CMIP6 models, but to varying degrees.
  This increase is linked to a weakening of the east-west temperature gradient in
  the tropical Pacific Ocean, which is evident across all models. Just as in previous
  generations of climate models, we find that many characteristics of future ENSO
  remain uncertain. This includes changes in dominant time scale, extratropical teleconnection
  patterns, and amplitude of El Nino and La Nina events. For models with the strongest
  increase in future variability, the majority of the increase happens in the Eastern
  Pacific, where the strongest El Nino events usually occur.
