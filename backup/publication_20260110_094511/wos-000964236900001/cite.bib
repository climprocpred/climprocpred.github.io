 abstract = {Subseasonal-to-seasonal (S2S) forecasts of atmospheric rivers (ARs) are    in high demand in the water supply management and flood control
communities. This study focuses on a new metric, the accumulated water
vapor transport associated with ARs, which is closely related to the
winter precipitation over the western U.S., and provides a multi-model
S2S prediction skill assessment. The prediction skill is evaluated at
lead time 1-4 weeks in four dynamical model hindcast data sets from
National Centers for Environmental Prediction (NCEP), European Center
for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF), Environment and Climate
Change Canada (ECCC), and Global Modeling and Assimilation Office (GMAO)
at National Aeronautics and Space Administration. Three reanalysis data
sets are used to evaluate the uncertainty of prediction skills related
to the choice of references. The AR-related water vapor transport is
underestimated in ECMWF and ECCC over most of the investigated region,
while its maximum has a southeastward shift in NCEP and GMAO at lead
time 3-4 weeks. The root mean square error, anomaly correlation
coefficient, and Brier skill score are calculated to quantify the
prediction skill in both deterministic and probabilistic sense. At
week-3 lead time, the models have significant skill near the lower
latitudes (<40 degrees N) of the eastern North Pacific, extending
northeastward to the California coastal area. Models have higher skills
in forecasting no and strong AR cases than weak cases. The Madden-Julian
Oscillation can modulate the prediction skill at week-3 lead over
central and Southern California, but with large uncertainties across
models.},
