 abstract = {The use of reduced numerical precision to reduce computing costs for the    cloud resolving model of superparameterized simulations of the
atmosphere is investigated. An approach to identify the optimal level of
precision for many different model components is presented, and a
detailed analysis of precision is performed. This is nontrivial for a
complex model that shows chaotic behavior such as the cloud resolving
model in this paper. It is shown not only that numerical precision can
be reduced significantly but also that the results of the reduced
precision analysis provide valuable information for the quantification
of model uncertainty for individual model components. The precision
analysis is also used to identify model parts that are of less
importance thus enabling a reduction of model complexity. It is shown
that the precision analysis can be used to improve model efficiency for
both simulations in double precision and in reduced precision. Model
simulations are performed with a superparameterized single-column model
version of the OpenIFS model that is forced by observational data sets.
A software emulator was used to mimic the use of reduced precision
floating point arithmetic in simulations.
Plain Language Summary Weather and climate models cannot represent
physical processes of the Earth System explicitly that are smaller than
the distance between model grid points. Due to limitations in computing
power, this distance is typically larger than 10 km in simulations of
the global atmosphere. However, the spatial scale for many important
physical processes, such as clouds, is much smaller than this and large
errors are generated for predictions of both weather and climate due to
limited resolution. To approximate the behavior of subgrid-scale
processes within atmosphere models, superparameterization was developed
that is running a two-dimensional small-scale model within each grid
column of the global model. Superparameterization can improve model
simulations but it causes a very large increase in computational cost in
comparison to standard simulations. To reduce computational cost, this
paper investigates whether it is possible to reduce numerical precision
when running the small-scale model. It is shown that precision can
indeed be reduced such that computing costs can potentially be reduced
significantly. It is also shown that results of an investigation of
reduced numerical precision provide valuable information for the
quantification of model uncertainty and model development.},
