 abstract = {Uncertainty quantification (UQ) in weather and climate models is    required to assess the sensitivity of their outputs to various
parameterization schemes and thereby improve their consistency with
observations. Herein, we present an efficient UQ and Bayesian inference
for the cloud parameters of the NCAR Single Column Atmosphere Model
(SCAM6) using surrogate models based on a polynomial chaos expansion.
The use of a surrogate model enables to efficiently propagate
uncertainties in parameters into uncertainties in model outputs. We
investigated eight uncertain parameters: the auto-conversion size
threshold for ice to snow (dcs), the fall speed parameter for stratiform
cloud ice (ai), the fall speed parameter for stratiform snow (as), the
fall speed parameter for cloud water (ac), the collection efficiency of
aggregation ice (eii), the efficiency factor of the Bergeron effect
(berg_eff), the threshold maximum relative humidity for ice clouds
(rhmaxi), and the threshold minimum relative humidity for ice clouds
(rhmini). We built two surrogate models using two non-intrusive methods:
spectral projection (SP) and basis pursuit denoising (BPDN). Our results
suggest that BPDN performs better than SP as it enables to filter out
internal noise during the process of fitting the surrogate model. Five
out of the eight parameters (namely dcs, ai, rhmaxi, rhmini, and eii)
account for most of the variance in predicted climate variables (e.g.,
total precipitation, cloud distribution, shortwave and longwave cloud
radiative effect, ice, and liquid water path). A first-order sensitivity
analysis reveals that dcs contributes similar to 40-80% of the total
variance of the climate variables, ai around 15-30\ %, and rhmaxi,
rhmini, and eii around 5-15\ %. The second- and higher-order effects
contribute similar to 7 and 20\ %, respectively. The sensitivity of the
model to these parameters was further explored using response curves. A
Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) sampling algorithm was also implemented
for the Bayesian inference of dcs, ai, as, rhmini, and berg\ _eff using
cloud distribution data collected at the Southern Great Plains (USA).
The inferred parameters suggest improvements in the global Climate Earth
System Model (CESM2) simulations of the tropics and sub-tropics.},
