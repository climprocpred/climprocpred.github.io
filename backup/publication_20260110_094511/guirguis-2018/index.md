abstract: Atmospheric rivers (ARs) are mechanisms of strong moisture transport capable
  of bringing heavy precipitation to the West Coast of North America, which drives
  water resources and can lead to large‐scale flooding. Understanding links between
  climate variability and landfalling ARs is critical for improving forecasts on timescales
  needed for water resource management. We examined 69 years of landfalling ARs along
  western North America using reanalysis and a long‐term AR catalog to identify circulation
  drivers of AR landfalls. This analysis reveals that AR activity along the West Coast
  is largely associated with a handful of influential modes of atmospheric variability.
  Interaction between these modes creates favorable or unfavorable atmospheric states
  for landfalling ARs at different locations, effectively steering moisture plumes
  up and down the coast from Mexico to British Columbia. Seasonal persistence of certain
  modes helps explain interannual variability of landfalling ARs, including recent
  California drought years and the wet winter of 2016/2017. Understanding links between
  large‐scale climate variability and landfalling ARs is important for improving subseasonal‐to‐seasonal
  (S2S) predictability of water resources in the western United States. We have analyzed
  a seven‐decade‐long catalog of ARs impacting western North America to quantify synoptic
  influence on AR activity. Our results identify dominant circulation patterns associated
  with landfalling ARs and show how seasonal variation in the prevalence of certain
  circulation features modulates the frequency of AR landfalls at different latitudes
  in a given year. AR variability played an important role in the recent California
  drought as well as the wet winter of 2016/2017, and we show how this variability
  was associated with the relative frequency of favorable versus unfavorable atmospheric
  states. Our findings also reveal that the bulk of AR landfalls along the West Coast
  is associated with only a handful of influential circulation features, which has
  implications for S2S predictability. AR activity along the West Coast is largely
  associated with a handful of influential modes of atmospheric variability Interaction
  between these modes creates favorable or unfavorable atmospheric states for landfalling
  ARs at different locations Seasonal persistence of certain modes helps explain interannual
  variability of landfalling ARs
