 abstract = {Marine ecosystem forecasting is an area of active research and rapid    development. Promise has been shown for skillful prediction of physical,
biogeochemical, and ecological variables on a range of timescales,
suggesting potential for forecasts to aid in the management of living
marine resources and coastal communities. However, the mechanisms
underlying forecast skill in marine ecosystems are often poorly
understood, and many forecasts, especially for biological variables,
rely on empirical statistical relationships developed from historical
observations. Here, we review statistical and dynamical marine ecosystem
forecasting methods and highlight examples of their application along
U.S. coastlines for seasonal-to-interannual (1-24 month) prediction of
properties ranging from coastal sea level to marine top predator
distributions. We then describe known mechanisms governing marine
ecosystem predictability and how they have been used in forecasts to
date. These mechanisms include physical atmospheric and oceanic
processes, biogeochemical and ecological responses to physical forcing,
and intrinsic characteristics of species themselves. In reviewing the
state of the knowledge on forecasting techniques and mechanisms
underlying marine ecosystem predictability, we aim to facilitate
forecast development and uptake by (i) identifying methods and processes
that can be exploited for development of skillful regional forecasts,
(ii) informing priorities for forecast development and verification, and
(iii) improving understanding of conditional forecast skill (i.e., a
priori knowledge of whether a forecast is likely to be skillful). While
we focus primarily on coastal marine ecosystems surrounding North
America (and the U.S. in particular), we detail forecast methods,
physical and biological mechanisms, and priority developments that are
globally relevant.},
