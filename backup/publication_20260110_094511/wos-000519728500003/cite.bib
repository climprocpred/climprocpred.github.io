 abstract = {A reliability budget is used to diagnose potential sources of error    (departure from observations) in a new prototype coupled
ocean-atmosphere ensemble Kalman filter reanalysis product, the
Community Earth System Model using the Data Assimilation Research
Testbed (CESM-DART). In areas with sufficient observations, the mean
bias in zonal wind was generally very low compared to the spread due to
ensemble variance, which did not exhibit patterns associated with
Northern Hemisphere jet streams but did have regional enhancement over
the Maritime Continent. However, the residual term was often the largest
contributor to the budget, which is problematic, suggesting improper
observational error statistics and inadequately represented ensemble
variance statistics. The departure and residual exhibit significant
seasonal variability, with a strong peak in boreal winter months,
indicating the model's deficiencies during the energetic Northern
Hemisphere winter. Ocean temperature contained large error in areas with
eddy production indicating inadequate ensemble variance due to poor
model resolution. Periods when the Madden-Julian Oscillation (MJO) was
active exhibited lower error, especially in the western equatorial
Pacific during MJO phases with reduced convection. In contrast, during
MJO phases with enhanced convection in that region, the ensemble
variance is increased yet the error is comparable to non-MJO conditions,
suggesting a controlling effect of the precipitation parameterization.
Further studies evaluating the impact of the coupled assimilation
procedure on the reliability budget will be illuminating.},
