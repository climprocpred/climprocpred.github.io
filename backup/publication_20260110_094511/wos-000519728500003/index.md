abstract: A reliability budget is used to diagnose potential sources of error    (departure
  from observations) in a new prototype coupled ocean-atmosphere ensemble Kalman filter
  reanalysis product, the Community Earth System Model using the Data Assimilation
  Research Testbed (CESM-DART). In areas with sufficient observations, the mean bias
  in zonal wind was generally very low compared to the spread due to ensemble variance,
  which did not exhibit patterns associated with Northern Hemisphere jet streams but
  did have regional enhancement over the Maritime Continent. However, the residual
  term was often the largest contributor to the budget, which is problematic, suggesting
  improper observational error statistics and inadequately represented ensemble variance
  statistics. The departure and residual exhibit significant seasonal variability,
  with a strong peak in boreal winter months, indicating the model's deficiencies
  during the energetic Northern Hemisphere winter. Ocean temperature contained large
  error in areas with eddy production indicating inadequate ensemble variance due
  to poor model resolution. Periods when the Madden-Julian Oscillation (MJO) was active
  exhibited lower error, especially in the western equatorial Pacific during MJO phases
  with reduced convection. In contrast, during MJO phases with enhanced convection
  in that region, the ensemble variance is increased yet the error is comparable to
  non-MJO conditions, suggesting a controlling effect of the precipitation parameterization.
  Further studies evaluating the impact of the coupled assimilation procedure on the
  reliability budget will be illuminating.
