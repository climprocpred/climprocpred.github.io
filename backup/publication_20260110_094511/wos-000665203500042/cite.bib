 abstract = {Coupled processes and associated subsurface dynamics near the eastern    edge of the Indo/western Pacific (WP) Warm Pool are important for
air-sea interactions involved in tropical Pacific dynamics. We seek to
shed light on the physical mechanisms governing air-sea interactions in
the region and the impacts of their biases in models. In this study, we
use the Ocean ReAnalysis System 5 (ORAS5) to identify mean-state biases
in the National Center for Atmospheric Research Community Earth System
Model version 2 (CESM2) with a particular focus on upper ocean
properties and air-sea interaction processes. We show that the CESM2 has
warm and fresh surface biases in the tropical Pacific Ocean, a barrier
layer that is too thin in the WP, and an isothermal layer depth (ILD)
that is too deep in the eastern Pacific (EP). These biases impact
air-sea interaction processes involved in El Nino development. We
compare the strong El Nino events in ORAS5 and CESM2 and show that
biases in barrier layer thickness in the WP and in ILD in the EP are
significant before the onset of the El Nino events. These biases then
influence vertical mixing and entrainment processes, resulting in mixed
layer cooling biases. Biases in the sea surface temperature seasonal
cycle in the CESM2 also influence the development of the El Nino. We
emphasize how the El Nino progression in models can be influenced by its
sensitivity to the mean state biases in both subsurface ocean structure
and seasonal cycle through local as well as the large-scale physical
processes.},
