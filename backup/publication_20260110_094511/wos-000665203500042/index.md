abstract: Coupled processes and associated subsurface dynamics near the eastern    edge
  of the Indo/western Pacific (WP) Warm Pool are important for air-sea interactions
  involved in tropical Pacific dynamics. We seek to shed light on the physical mechanisms
  governing air-sea interactions in the region and the impacts of their biases in
  models. In this study, we use the Ocean ReAnalysis System 5 (ORAS5) to identify
  mean-state biases in the National Center for Atmospheric Research Community Earth
  System Model version 2 (CESM2) with a particular focus on upper ocean properties
  and air-sea interaction processes. We show that the CESM2 has warm and fresh surface
  biases in the tropical Pacific Ocean, a barrier layer that is too thin in the WP,
  and an isothermal layer depth (ILD) that is too deep in the eastern Pacific (EP).
  These biases impact air-sea interaction processes involved in El Nino development.
  We compare the strong El Nino events in ORAS5 and CESM2 and show that biases in
  barrier layer thickness in the WP and in ILD in the EP are significant before the
  onset of the El Nino events. These biases then influence vertical mixing and entrainment
  processes, resulting in mixed layer cooling biases. Biases in the sea surface temperature
  seasonal cycle in the CESM2 also influence the development of the El Nino. We emphasize
  how the El Nino progression in models can be influenced by its sensitivity to the
  mean state biases in both subsurface ocean structure and seasonal cycle through
  local as well as the large-scale physical processes.
