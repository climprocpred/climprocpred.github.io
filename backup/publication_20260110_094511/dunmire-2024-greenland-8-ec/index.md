abstract: 'Supraglacial lakes on the Greenland Ice Sheet (GrIS) can impact both the
  ice sheet surface mass balance and ice dynamics. Thus, understanding the evolution
  and dynamics of supraglacial lakes is important to provide improved parameterizations
  for ice sheet models to enable better projections of future GrIS changes. In this
  study, we utilize the growing inventory of optical and microwave satellite imagery
  to automatically determine the fate of Greenland-wide supraglacial lakes during
  2018 and 2019; cool and warm melt seasons respectively. We develop a novel time
  series classification method to categorize lakes into four classes: 1) refreezing,
  2) rapidly draining, 3) slowly draining, and 4) buried. Our findings reveal significant
  interannual variability between the two melt seasons, with a notable increase in
  the proportion of draining lakes in 2019. We also find that as mean lake depth increases,
  so does the percentage of lakes that drain, indicating that lake depth may influence
  hydrofracture potential. However, we also observe that non-draining lakes are deeper
  during the cooler 2018 melt season, suggesting that additional factors may predispose
  lakes to drain earlier in a warmer year. Our automatic classification approach and
  the resulting two-year ice-sheet-wide dataset provide unprecedented insights into
  GrIS supraglacial lake dynamics and evolution, offering a valuable resource for
  future research.'
