 abstract = {A new approach for improving the accuracy of data assimilation, by    trading numerical precision for ensemble size, is introduced. Data
assimilation is inherently uncertain because of the use of noisy
observations and imperfect models. Thus, the larger rounding errors
incurred from reducing precision may be within the tolerance of the
system. Lower-precision arithmetic is cheaper, and so by reducing
precision in ensemble data assimilation, computational resources can be
redistributed toward, for example, a larger ensemble size. Because
larger ensembles provide a better estimate of the underlying
distribution and are less reliant on covariance inflation and
localization, lowering precision could actually permit an improvement in
the accuracy ofweather forecasts. Here, this idea is tested on an
ensemble data assimilation systemcomprising the Lorenz ` 96 toy
atmospheric model and the ensemble square root filter. The system is run
at double-, single-, and halfprecision (the latter using an emulation
tool), and the performance of each precision ismeasured throughmean
error statistics and rank histograms. The sensitivity of these results
to the observation error and the length of the observation window are
addressed. Then, by reinvesting the saved computational resources from
reducing precision into the ensemble size, assimilation error can be
reduced for (hypothetically) no extra cost. This results in increased
forecasting skill, with respect to double-precision assimilation.},
