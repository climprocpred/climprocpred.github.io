 abstract = {The upper ocean stratification and circulation in the Bay of Bengal    (BOB) plays a key role in the northward propagating monsoon
intraseasonal oscillation during the months of June-August. This region
is highly influenced by strong, seasonal atmospheric forcing and the
oceanic circulation is characterized by dominant mesoscale variability
and strong horizontal gradients in salinity and temperature during the
monsoon period. Given the role of the ocean in the monsoon circulation,
it is important to investigate accurate ocean state estimates and
forecasts of the BoB ocean circulation in preparation for coupled
ocean-atmosphere modeling and predictions. Hence, we use a
mesoscale-permitting regional implementation of Massachusetts Institute
of Technology general circulation model (MITgcm) and its adjoint-based
four-dimensional variational (4DVAR) system to assimilate
satellite-derived Sea Surface Height (SSH) and Sea Surface Temperature
(SST) data in the BoB for a period of one month (June 1 - 30, 2017). It
is shown that the MITgcm-BoB 4DVAR assimilation system is able to
significantly improve the model consistency with the assimilated
observations in the BoB region, reducing the model-data misfit by 50%
and provided a dynamically-consistent BoB ocean circulation for the
one-month hindcast period. We performed forecasting experiments using
the state estimate to initialize two forecasts for a period of 30-days
(July 1- 30, 2017) from the end of the hindcast period. These forecasts
used either atmosphere reanalysis and ocean analysis forcings or monthly
climatology of atmosphere reanalysis and ocean analysis forcings. They
therefore do not represent a ``true'' regional ocean forecast, forced
using actual atmosphere and ocean forecasts, but bound the performance
between climatological and nearly perfect forecasts. The model forecast
is a cross-validation against future observations and showed that the
initial conditions from the state estimate improves the prediction of
the three-dimensional circulation in the BoB. The model hindcast and
forecasts were also cross-validated against independent Argo temperature
and salinity observations in the BoB. Additional state estimation and
forecast experiments for other periods showed similar model performance
with improved hindcasts and forecasts for the BoB region.},
