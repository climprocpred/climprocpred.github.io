 abstract = {A new regional coupled ocean-atmosphere model is developed and its    implementation is presented in this paper. The coupled model is based on
two open-source community model components: the MITgcm ocean model and
the Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) atmosphere model. The
coupling between these components is performed using ESMF (Earth System
Modeling Framework) and implemented according to National United
Operational Prediction Capability (NUOPC) protocols. The coupled model
is named the Scripps-KAUST Regional Integrated Prediction System
(SKRIPS). SKRIPS is demonstrated with a real-world example by simulating
a 30 d period including a series of extreme heat events occurring on the
eastern shore of the Red Sea region in June 2012. The results obtained
by using the coupled model, along with those in forced stand-alone
oceanic or atmospheric simulations, are compared with observational data
and reanalysis products. We show that the coupled model is capable of
performing coupled ocean-atmosphere simulations, although all
configurations of coupled and uncoupled models have good skill in
modeling the heat events. In addition, a scalability test is performed
to investigate the parallelization of the coupled model. The results
indicate that the coupled model code scales well and the ESMF/NUOPC
coupler accounts for less than 5% of the total computational resources
in the Red Sea test case. The coupled model and documentation are
