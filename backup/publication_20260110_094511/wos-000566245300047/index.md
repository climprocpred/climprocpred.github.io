abstract: Precipitation in California is highly variable and not well forecasted    on
  subseasonal-to-seasonal (S2S) timescales. Understanding relationships between synoptic-scale
  atmospheric circulation and hydrometeorological extremes could improve predictability.
  This work demonstrates the importance of four North Pacific circulation regimes
  (called the NP4 modes) in modulating precipitation, flooding, and water resources
  in California. Here we demonstrate how, on daily timescales, interactions between
  the NP4 modes drive coastal flow that can result in dry conditions from atmospheric
  ridging or wet conditions associated with enhanced onshore flow and atmospheric
  river (AR) landfalls. Seasonally, the prevalence of certain NP4 phase relationships
  can tip the scale toward wet or dry conditions. Relationships between El Nino Southern
  Oscillation (ENSO) and the NP4 are explored, and we provide insight into the poorly
  forecasted Western US seasonal precipitation during the ``Godzilla'' El Nino winter
  of 2016 by examining climate-weather linkages in a historical context.
