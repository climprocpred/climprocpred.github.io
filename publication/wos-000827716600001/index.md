abstract: Floods caused by atmospheric rivers and wildfires fanned by Santa Ana    winds
  are common occurrences in California with devastating societal impacts. In this
  work, we show that winter weather variability in California, including the occurrence
  of extreme and impactful events, is linked to four atmospheric circulation regimes
  over the North Pacific Ocean previously named and identified as the ``NP4 modes''.
  These modes come in and out of phase with each other during the season, resulting
  in distinct weather patterns that recur throughout the historical record. Some phase
  combinations favor atmospheric river landfalls and extreme daily or multi-day precipitation,
  while other phase combinations favor anomalously hot weather and drying Santa Ana
  wind conditions over Southern California. This historical perspective of atmospheric
  circulation and impacts over 70 years reveals that weather patterns are changing
  in a way that enhances wildfire hazard in California, while the frequency of weather
  patterns linked to historical floods is not diminishing. These changes highlight
  the rising hazards of cascading weather extremes in California's present and future.
