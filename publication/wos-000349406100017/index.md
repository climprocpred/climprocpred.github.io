abstract: A suite of statistical atmosphere-only linear inverse models of varying    complexity
  are used to hindcast recent MJO events from the Year of Tropical Convection and
  the Cooperative Indian Ocean Experiment on Intraseasonal Variability/Dynamics of
  the Madden-Julian Oscillation mission periods, as well as over the 2000-2009 time
  period. Skill exists for over two weeks, competitive with the skill of some numerical
  models in both bivariate correlation and root-mean-squared-error scores during both
  observational mission periods. Skill is higher during mature Madden-Julian Oscillation
  conditions, as opposed to during growth phases, suggesting that growth dynamics
  may be more complex or non-linear since they are not as well captured by a linear
  model. There is little prediction skill gained by including non-leading modes of
  variability.
