 abstract = {A suite of statistical atmosphere-only linear inverse models of varying    complexity are used to hindcast recent MJO events from the Year of
Tropical Convection and the Cooperative Indian Ocean Experiment on
Intraseasonal Variability/Dynamics of the Madden-Julian Oscillation
mission periods, as well as over the 2000-2009 time period. Skill exists
for over two weeks, competitive with the skill of some numerical models
in both bivariate correlation and root-mean-squared-error scores during
both observational mission periods. Skill is higher during mature
Madden-Julian Oscillation conditions, as opposed to during growth
phases, suggesting that growth dynamics may be more complex or
non-linear since they are not as well captured by a linear model. There
is little prediction skill gained by including non-leading modes of
variability.},
