 abstract = {The Red Sea, home to the second-longest coral reef system in the world,    is a vital resource for the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia. The Red Sea
provides 90% of the Kingdom's potable water by desalinization,
supporting tourism, shipping, aquaculture, and fishing industries, which
together contribute about 10\ %-20\ % of the country's GDP. All these
activities, and those elsewhere in the Red Sea region, critically depend
on oceanic and atmospheric conditions. At a time of mega-development
projects along the Red Sea coast, and global warming, authorities are
working on optimizing the harnessing of environmental resources,
including renewable energy and rainwater harvesting. All these require
high-resolution weather and climate information. Toward this end, we
have undertaken a multipronged research and development activity in
which we are developing an integrated data-driven regional coupled
modeling system. The telescopically nested components include 5-km- to
600-m-resolution atmospheric models to address weather and climate
challenges, 4-km- to 50-m-resolution ocean models with regional and
coastal configurations to simulate and predict the general and mesoscale
circulation, 4-km- to 100-m-resolution ecosystem models to simulate the
biogeochemistry, and 1-km- to 50-m-resolution wave models. In addition,
a complementary probabilistic transport modeling system predicts
dispersion of contaminant plumes, oil spill, and marine ecosystem
connectivity. Advanced ensemble data assimilation capabilities have also
been implemented for accurate forecasting. Resulting achievements
include significant advancement in our understanding of the regional
circulation and its connection to the global climate, development, and
validation of long-term Red Sea regional atmospheric-oceanic-wave
reanalyses and forecasting capacities. These products are being
extensively used by academia, government, and industry in various
weather and marine studies and operations, environmental policies,
renewable energy applications, impact assessment, flood forecasting, and
more.},
