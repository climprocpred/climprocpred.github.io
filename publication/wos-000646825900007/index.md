abstract: The Red Sea, home to the second-longest coral reef system in the world,    is
  a vital resource for the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia. The Red Sea provides 90% of the
  Kingdom's potable water by desalinization, supporting tourism, shipping, aquaculture,
  and fishing industries, which together contribute about 10 %-20 % of the country's
  GDP. All these activities, and those elsewhere in the Red Sea region, critically
  depend on oceanic and atmospheric conditions. At a time of mega-development projects
  along the Red Sea coast, and global warming, authorities are working on optimizing
  the harnessing of environmental resources, including renewable energy and rainwater
  harvesting. All these require high-resolution weather and climate information. Toward
  this end, we have undertaken a multipronged research and development activity in
  which we are developing an integrated data-driven regional coupled modeling system.
  The telescopically nested components include 5-km- to 600-m-resolution atmospheric
  models to address weather and climate challenges, 4-km- to 50-m-resolution ocean
  models with regional and coastal configurations to simulate and predict the general
  and mesoscale circulation, 4-km- to 100-m-resolution ecosystem models to simulate
  the biogeochemistry, and 1-km- to 50-m-resolution wave models. In addition, a complementary
  probabilistic transport modeling system predicts dispersion of contaminant plumes,
  oil spill, and marine ecosystem connectivity. Advanced ensemble data assimilation
  capabilities have also been implemented for accurate forecasting. Resulting achievements
  include significant advancement in our understanding of the regional circulation
  and its connection to the global climate, development, and validation of long-term
  Red Sea regional atmospheric-oceanic-wave reanalyses and forecasting capacities.
  These products are being extensively used by academia, government, and industry
  in various weather and marine studies and operations, environmental policies, renewable
  energy applications, impact assessment, flood forecasting, and more.
