 abstract = {This paper examines the empirical relationship between the Madden-Julian    oscillation (MJO), the quasi-biennial oscillation (QBO), and atmospheric
river (AR) activity and precipitation in California on subseasonal time
scales. We introduce an experimental forecast tool that uses observed
anomaly patterns during a 38 yr period to predict the probability of
above- and below-normal AR activity and precipitation at lead times of
1-6 weeks based on the phase and amplitude of the MJO and QBO. The
hindcast prediction skill of probabilistic AR activity and precipitation
forecasts is evaluated for Northern, Central, and Southern California,
as well as two sets of smaller geographical domains. These smaller
domains are more relevant for water resource management and allow us to
investigate the sensitivity of prediction skill to domain size.
Consistent with previous studies, our results demonstrate that
subseasonal AR activity and precipitation in California are strongly
modulated by the MJO and QBO. The anomaly patterns of AR activity and
precipitation vary considerably throughout the cool season, with a
tendency toward below-normal AR activity and precipitation during
easterly QBO and above-normal AR activity and precipitation during
westerly QBO in JFM. The opposite patterns are generally observed in
OND, but the anomaly signals are weaker and less coherent for AR
activity. Certain combinations of MJO phase, QBO phase, lag time, and
season yield notably higher skill scores, reinforcing the notion of
``windows of opportunity `` for skillful subseasonal-to-seasonal
predictions. In California, these forecasts of opportunity are
predominantly associated with easterly QBO in JFM and FMA.},
