 abstract = {Stochastic parameterizations account for uncertainty in the    representation of unresolved subgrid processes by sampling from the
distribution of possible subgrid forcings. Some existing stochastic
parameterizations utilize data-driven approaches to characterize
uncertainty, but these approaches require significant structural
assumptions that can limit their scalability. Machine learning models,
including neural networks, are able to represent a wide range of
distributions and build optimized mappings between a large number of
inputs and subgrid forcings. Recent research on machine learning
parameterizations has focused only on deterministic parameterizations.
In this study, we develop a stochastic parameterization using the
generative adversarial network (GAN) machine learning framework. The GAN
stochastic parameterization is trained and evaluated on output from the
Lorenz `96 model, which is a common baseline model for evaluating both
parameterization and data assimilation techniques. We evaluate different
ways of characterizing the input noise for the model and perform model
runs with the GAN parameterization at weather and climate time scales.
Some of the GAN configurations perform better than a baseline bespoke
parameterization at both time scales, and the networks closely reproduce
the spatiotemporal correlations and regimes of the Lorenz `96 system. We
also find that, in general, those models which produce skillful
forecasts are also associated with the best climate simulations.
Plain Language Summary Simulations of the atmosphere must approximate
the effects of small-scale processes with simplified functions called
parameterizations. Standard parameterizations only predict one output
for a given input, but stochastic parameterizations can sample from all
the possible outcomes that can occur under certain conditions. We have
developed and evaluated a machine learning stochastic parameterization,
which builds a mapping between large-scale current conditions and the
range of small-scale outcomes from data about both. We test the machine
learning stochastic parameterization in a simplified mathematical
simulation that produces multiscale chaotic waves like the atmosphere.
We find that some configurations of the machine learning stochastic
parameterization perform slightly better than a simpler baseline
stochastic parameterization over both weather- and climate-like time
spans.},
