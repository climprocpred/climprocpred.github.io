 abstract = {The causes of the extreme and persistent warming in the Northeast    Pacific from the winter of 2013/14 to that of 2014/15 are still not
fully understood. While global warming may have contributed, natural
influences may also have played a role. El Nino events are often
implicated in anomalously warm conditions along the US West Coast
(USWC). However, the tropical Pacific sea surface temperature (SST)
anomalies were generally weak during 2014, calling into question their
role in the USWC warming. In this study, we identify tropical Pacific
``sensitivity patterns'' that optimally force USWC warming at a later
time. We find that such sensitivity patterns do not coincide with the
mature SST anomaly patterns usually associated with ENSO, but instead
include elements associated with ENSO SST precursors and SST anomalies
in the central/western equatorial Pacific. El Nino events that produce
large USWC warming, irrespective of their magnitude, do project on the
sensitivity pattern and are characterized by a distinct evolution of the
North Pacific atmospheric and oceanic fields. However, even weak
tropical SST anomalies in the right location, and not necessarily
associated with ENSO, can significantly influence USWC conditions and
enhance their predictability.},
