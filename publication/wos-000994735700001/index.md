abstract: The Sierra Nevada and Southern Cascades-California's snowy mountains-are    primary
  freshwater sources and natural reservoirs for the states of California and Nevada.
  These mountains receive precipitation overwhelmingly from wintertime storms including
  atmospheric rivers (ARs), much of it falling as snow at the higher elevations. Using
  a seven-decade record of daily observed temperature and precipitation as well as
  a snow reanalysis and downscaled climate projections, we documented historical and
  future changes in snow accumulation and snowlines. In four key subregions of California's
  snowy mountains, we quantified the progressing contribution of ARs and non-AR storms
  to the evolving and projected snow accumulation and snowlines (elevation of the
  snow-to-rain transition), exploring their climatology, variability and trends. Historically,
  snow makes up roughly a third of the precipitation affecting California's mountains.
  While ARs make up only a quarter of all precipitating days and, due to their relative
  warmth, produce snowlines higher than do other storms, they contribute over 40%
  of the total seasonal snow. Under projected unabated warming, snow accumulation
  would decline to less than half of historical by the late twenty-first century,
  with the greatest snow loss at mid elevations (from 1500 to 3300 m by the mountain
  sub-regions) during fall and spring. Central and Southern Sierra Nevada peaks above
  3400 m might see occasionally extreme snow accumulations in January-February resulting
  entirely from wetter ARs. AR-related snowlines are projected to increase by more
  than 700 m, compared to about 500 m for other storms. We discuss likely impacts
  of the changing climate for water resources as well as for winter recreation.
