 abstract = {Atmospheric rivers (ARs) play a key role in California's water supply    and are responsible for most of the extreme precipitation and major
flooding along the west coast of North America. Given the high societal
impact, it is critical to improve our understanding and prediction of
ARs. This study uses a regional coupled ocean-atmosphere modeling system
to make hindcasts of ARs up to 14 days. Two groups of coupled runs are
highlighted in the comparison: (1) ARs occurring during times with
strong sea surface temperature (SST) cooling and (2) ARs occurring
during times with weak SST cooling. During the events with strong SST
cooling, the coupled model simulates strong upward air-sea heat fluxes
associated with ARs; on the other hand, when the SST cooling is weak,
the coupled model simulates downward air-sea heat fluxes in the AR
region. Validation data shows that the coupled model skillfully
reproduces the evolving SST, as well as the surface turbulent heat
transfers between the ocean and atmosphere. The roles of air-sea
interactions in AR events are investigated by comparing coupled model
hindcasts to hindcasts made using persistent SST. To evaluate the
influence of the ocean on ARs we analyze two representative variables of
AR intensity, the vertically integrated water vapor (IWV) and integrated
vapor transport (IVT). During strong SST cooling AR events the simulated
IWV is improved by about 12% in the coupled run at lead times greater
than one week. For IVT, which is about twice more variable, the
improvement in the coupled run is about 5\ %.
Plain Language Summary Atmospheric rivers (ARs) play a key role in
extreme precipitation along the west coast of North America. Because of
their important societal impact, an improved understanding of ARs is
critical. In the present work, we use a coupled ocean-atmosphere
modeling system to investigate the role of air-sea interactions in
simulating ARs. We highlight two groups in our simulations for which the
ocean's response to ARs differs. One group is associated with strong
ocean cooling, where the ocean cools everywhere. The other group is
associated with weak ocean cooling, where the ARs can warm part of the
ocean. We investigate the AR water vapor content and transport to
evaluate the ocean's impact on ARs. We find that the coupled model
better simulates the air-sea exchanges and AR water vapor content. The
improvements are more significant during the AR events associated with
strong ocean cooling.},
