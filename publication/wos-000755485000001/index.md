abstract: Projections of future climate are sensitive to the representation of    upper-ocean
  diurnal variability, including the diurnal cycle of winds. Two different methods
  suitable for time series with missing data are used here to characterize how observed
  diurnal winds vary over the year. One is based on diurnal composites of mooring
  data, and the other is based on harmonic analysis via a least squares fit and is
  able to isolate annual (i.e., 1 cycle per year) modulation of diurnal variability.
  Results show that the diurnal amplitude in meridional winds is larger than in zonal
  winds and peaks in the tropical Pacific, where diurnal variability in zonal winds
  is overall weaker compared to other basins. Furthermore, the amplitude and phasing
  of diurnal winds in the tropical oceans are not uniform in time, with overall larger
  differences through the year in the meridional component of tropical winds. Estimating
  the annual modulation of the diurnal signal implies resolving both the diurnal energy
  peak and also the modulation of this peak by the annual cycle. This leads to a recommendation
  for sampling at least 6 times per day and for a duration of at least 3 years.
