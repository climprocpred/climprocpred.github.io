abstract = {{A new approach is proposed to address the background covariance limitations arising from undersampled ensembles and unaccounted model errors in the ensemble Kalman filter (EnKF). The method enhances the representativeness of the EnKF ensemble by augmenting it with new members chosen adaptively to add missing information that prevents the EnKF from fully fitting the data to the ensemble. The vectors to be added are obtained by back projecting the residuals of the observation misfits from the EnKF analysis step onto the state space. The back projection is done using an optimal interpolation (OI) scheme based on an estimated covariance of the subspace missing from the ensemble. In the experiments reported here, the OI uses a preselected stationary background covariance matrix, as in the hybrid EnKF–three-dimensional variational data assimilation (3DVAR) approach, but the resulting correction is included as a new ensemble member instead of being added to all existing ensemble members. The adaptive approach is tested with the Lorenz-96 model. The hybrid EnKF–3DVAR is used as a benchmark to evaluate the performance of the adaptive approach. Assimilation experiments suggest that the new adaptive scheme significantly improves the EnKF behavior when it suffers from small size ensembles and neglected model errors. It was further found to be competitive with the hybrid EnKF–3DVAR approach, depending on ensemble size and data coverage.}},

   The U.S. Climate Variability and Predictability (CLIVAR) MJO Working
   Group's prescribed diagnostic tests are used to evaluate the model's
   mean state, variance, and wavenumber frequency characteristics in a
   20-yr simulation of the intraseasonal variability in zonal winds at 850
   hPa (U850) and 200 hPa (U200), and outgoing longwave radiation (OLR).
   Unlike its predecessor, CCSM4 reproduces a number of aspects of MJO
   behavior more realistically.
   The CCSM4 produces coherent, broadbanded, and energetic patterns in
   eastward-propagating intraseasonal zonal winds and OLR in the tropical
   Indian and Pacific Oceans that are generally consistent with MJO
   characteristics. Strong peaks occur in power spectra and coherence
   spectra with periods between 20 and 100 days and zonal wavenumbers
   between 1 and 3. Model MJOs, however, tend to be more broadbanded in
   frequency than in observations. Broad-scale patterns, as revealed in
   combined EOFs of U850, U200, and OLR, are remarkably consistent with
   observations and indicate that large-scale convergence convection
   coupling occurs in the simulated MJO.
   Relations between MJO in the model and its concurrence with other
   climate states are also explored. MJO activity (defined as the
   percentage of time the MJO index exceeds 1.5) is enhanced during El Nino
   events compared to La Nina events, both in the model and observations.
   MJO activity is increased during periods of anomalously strong negative
   meridional wind shear in the Asian monsoon region and also during strong
   negative Indian Ocean zonal mode states, in both the model and
   observations.}},

The filters have a very similar forecast step but the analysis step of the PF solves the full Bayesian filtering problem while the EnKF analysis only applies to Gaussian distributions. The EnKF is compared to two flavors of the particle filter with different sampling strategies, the sequential importance resampling filter (SIRF) and the sequential kernel resampling filter (SKRF). The model admits a chaotic vortical mode coupled to a comparatively fast gravity wave mode. It can also be configured either to evolve on a so-called slow manifold, where the fast motion is suppressed, or such that the fast-varying variables are diagnosed from the slow-varying variables as slaved modes. Identical twin experiments show that EnKF and PF capture the variables on the slow manifold well as the dynamics is very stable. PFs, especially the SKRF, capture slaved modes better than the EnKF, implying that a full Bayesian analysis estimates the nonlinear model variables better. The PFs perform significantly better in the fully coupled nonlinear model where fast and slow variables modulate each other. This suggests that the analysis step in the PFs maintains the balance in both variables much better than the EnKF. It is also shown that increasing the ensemble size generally improves the performance of the PFs but has less impact on the EnKF after a sufficient number of members have been used.}},

The work is based on the adaptive EnKF (AEnKF) method, which bears a strong resemblance to the hybrid EnKF/three-dimensional variational data assimilation (3D-VAR) method. In the AEnKF, the representativeness of the EnKF ensemble is regularly enhanced with new members generated after back projection of the EnKF analysis residuals to state space using a 3D-VAR [or optimal interpolation (OI)] scheme with a preselected background covariance matrix. The idea here is to reformulate the transformation of the residuals as a 4D-VAR problem, constraining the new member with model dynamics and the previous observations. This should provide more information for the estimation of the new member and reduce dependence of the AEnKF on the assumed stationary background covariance matrix. This is done by integrating the analysis residuals backward in time with the adjoint model. Numerical experiments are performed with the Lorenz-96 model under different scenarios to test the new approach and to evaluate its performance with respect to the EnKF and the hybrid EnKF/3D-VAR. The new method leads to the least root-mean-square estimation errors as long as the linear assumption guaranteeing the stability of the adjoint model holds.

An algorithm that identifies winding angles was employed to detect 4998 eddies propagating along 938 unique eddy tracks. Statistics suggest that eddies are generated across the entire Red Sea but that they are prevalent in certain regions. A high number of eddies is found in the central basin between 18°N and 24°N. More than 87\% of the detected eddies have a radius ranging from 50 to 135 km. Both the intensity and relative vorticity scale of these eddies decrease as the eddy radii increase. The averaged eddy lifespan is approximately 6 weeks. AEs and cyclonic eddies (CEs) have different deformation features, and those with stronger intensities are less deformed and more circular. Analysis of long‐lived eddies suggests that they are likely to appear in the central basin with AEs tending to move northward. In addition, their eddy kinetic energy (EKE) increases gradually throughout their lifespans. The annual cycles of CEs and AEs differ, although both exhibit significant seasonal cycles of intensity with the winter and summer peaks appearing in February and August, respectively. The seasonal cycle of EKE is negatively correlated with stratification but positively correlated with vertical shear of horizontal velocity and eddy growth rate, suggesting that the generation of baroclinic instability is responsible for the activities of eddies in the Red Sea.

The analysis is based on the October 2011 MJO event observed during the Dynamics of the Madden–Julian Oscillation field campaign. The model captures the MJO initiation but, compared to the observations, the hindcast has a faster MJO phase speed, a dry relative humidity bias, a stronger zonal wind shear, and a weaker MJO peak amplitude. The MJO hindcast is then nudged toward the European Centre for Medium‐Range Weather Forecast Reanalysis fields of temperature, specific humidity, horizontal winds, and surface pressure. The nudging tendencies highlight the model physics parameterization biases, such as not enough convective diabatic heating during the MJO initiation, not enough upper tropospheric stratiform condensation, and lower tropospheric reevaporation during the mature and decay phases and a strong zonal wind shear during the MJO evolution. To determine the role of temperature, specific humidity, and horizontal winds in the model physics parameterization errors, six additional nudging experiments are carried out, with either one or two of the fields allowed to evolve freely while the others are nudged. Results show that convection and precipitation increase when temperature or specific humidity are unconstrained and decrease when horizontal winds evolve freely or temperature alone is constrained to reanalysis. Budget analysis of moist static energy shows that the nudging tendency compensates for different process biases during different MJO phases. The diagnosis of such nudging tendencies provides a unique objective way to identify model physics biases, which usefully guides the model physics parameterization development.

   diurnal moistening of the troposphere by collocating the diurnal peak in

   simulations further elucidate the role of SST conditions in the
   predictive skill of MJO. The atmospheric model forced with the
   persistent initial SST, lacking enhanced preconvection warming and
   moistening, produces a weaker and delayed convection than the diurnally

   Since 2004, the Southern California Bight (SCB) and the oceanic region
   offshore has also been the site for the California Current Ecosystem
   (CCE) Long-Term Ecological Research (LTER) program, which has
   established long-term observational time series and executed several
   Process Cruises to better understand physical biological variations,
   fluxes and interactions. Since the inception of the CCE-LTER, many new
   ideas have emerged about what physical processes are the key controls on
   CCS dynamics. These new perspectives include obtaining a better
   understanding of what climate patterns exert influences on CCS physical
   variations and what physical controls are most important in driving CCE
   ecological changes.
   Physical oceanographic and climatological conditions in the CCS varied
   widely since the inception of the CCE-LTER observational time series,
   including unusual climate events and persistently anomalous states.
   Although the CCE-LTER project commenced in 2004 in the midst of normal
   ocean conditions near the climatological means, over the following
   decade, El Nino/Southern Oscillation conditions flickered weakly from
   warm to cold, with the Pacific Decadal Oscillation (PDO) generally
   tracking that behavior, while the North Pacific Gyre Oscillation (NPGO)
   evolved to persistent and strong positive conditions after 2007,
   indicative of enhanced upwelling from 2007 to 2012. Together the
   combined impact of the negative PDO state (La Nina conditions) and
   positive NPGO state (increased upwelling conditions) yielded remarkably
   persistent cool conditions in the CCS from late 2007 to early 2009 and
   from mid-2010 through 2012.
   The broad-scale climate variations that occurred over the North Pacific
   and CCS during this time period are discussed here to provide physical
   context for the CCE-LTER time series observations and the CCE-LTER
   Process Cruises. Data assimilation fits, using the Regional Ocean
   Modeling System four-dimensional data assimilation framework, were
   successfully executed for the 1-month time period surrounding each of
   the Process Cruises. The fits provide additional information about how
   the physical flows evolve during the course of the multi-week Process
   Cruises. Relating these physical states to the numerous biological
   measurements gathered by the CCE-LTER time series observations and
   during the Process Cruises will yield vital long-term perspective of how
   changing climate conditions control the ocean ecosystem in this region
   and information on how this important ecosystem can be expected to
   evolve over the coming decades. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Eddies acquire kinetic energy from conversion of eddy available potential energy (EPE), from transfer of mean kinetic energy (MKE), and from direct generation due to time‐varying (turbulent) wind stress, the first of which contributes predominantly to the majority of the EKE. The EPE‐to‐EKE conversion occurs almost in the entire basin, while the MKE‐to‐EKE transfer appears mainly along the shelf boundary of the basin (200 m isobath) where high horizontal shear interacts with topography. The EKE generated by the turbulent wind stress is relatively small and limited to the southern basin. All these processes are intensified during winter, when the rate of energy conversion is about 4–5 times larger than that in summer. The EKE is redistributed by the vertical and horizontal divergence of energy flux and the advection of the mean flow. As a main sink of EKE, dissipation processes is ubiquitously found in the basin.

The diurnal cycle associated with diurnal solar insolation and nighttime cooling, may act, along with stochastic wind variability, on upper ocean temperatures and stratification resulting in a diurnal warm layer and a nonlinear rectified effect on longer time scales. This study describes diurnal changes in upper ocean temperature for a location in the equatorial Indian Ocean, using observations from the Dynamics of the Madden‐Julian Oscillation field campaign, a high vertical resolution 1‐D process model, and a diurnal cycling scheme. Solar forcing is the main driver of diurnal variability in upper ocean temperature and stratification. Yet except during nighttime convection, winds with variability on the order of hours (here referred to as “wind gusts”) regulate how fast surface water is mixed to greater depths when daily mean winds are weak. Wind gusts are much stronger than diurnal winds. Even using stochastic wind gusts but no diurnal winds as input in a 1‐D process model yields an estimate of diurnal temperature that compares well with observations. A new version of the Large and Caron (2015) scheme (LC2015) provides an estimate of upper ocean diurnal temperature that is consistent with observations. LC2015 has the advantage of being suitable for implementation in a climate model, with the goal to improve SST estimates, hence the simulated heat flux at the air‐sea interface. Yet LC2015 is not very sensitive to the inclusion or omission of the high‐frequency component of the wind.

   statistical linear inverse models (LIM). Observed monthly SST anomalies
   in the Atlantic sector (between 22S and 66N) are used to construct the
   LIMs for seasonal and decadal prediction. The forecast skills of the
   LIMs are then compared to that from two current operational forecast
   systems. Results indicate that the LIM has good forecast skill for time
   periods of 3-4 months on the seasonal timescale with enhanced
   predictability in the spring season. On decadal timescales, the impact
   of inter-annual and intra-annual variability on the predictability is
   also investigated. The results show that the suite of LIMs have forecast
   skill for about 3-4 years over most of the domain when we use only the
   decadal variability for the construction of the LIM. Including higher
   frequency variability helps improve the forecast skill and maintains the
   correlation of LIM predictions with the observed SST anomalies for
   longer periods. These results indicate the importance of temporal scale
   interactions in improving predictability on decadal timescales. Hence,
   LIMs can not only be used as benchmarks for estimates of statistical
   skill but also to isolate contributions to the forecast skills from
   different timescales, spatial scales or even model components.}},

abstract = {{Stochastic schemes to represent model uncertainty in the European Centre for Medium‐Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF) ensemble prediction system has helped improve its probabilistic forecast skill over the past decade by both improving its reliability and reducing the ensemble mean error. The largest uncertainties in the model arise from the model physics parameterizations. In the tropics, the parameterization of moist convection presents a major challenge for the accurate prediction of weather and climate. Superparameterization is a promising alternative strategy for including the effects of moist convection through explicit turbulent fluxes calculated from a cloud‐resolving model (CRM) embedded within a global climate model (GCM). In this paper, we compare the impact of initial random perturbations in embedded CRMs, within the ECMWF ensemble prediction system, with stochastically perturbed physical tendency (SPPT) scheme as a way to represent model uncertainty in medium‐range tropical weather forecasts. We especially focus on forecasts of tropical convection and dynamics during MJO events in October–November 2011. These are well‐studied events for MJO dynamics as they were also heavily observed during the DYNAMO field campaign. We show that a multiscale ensemble modeling approach helps improve forecasts of certain aspects of tropical convection during the MJO events, while it also tends to deteriorate certain large‐scale dynamic fields with respect to stochastically perturbed physical tendencies approach that is used operationally at ECMWF. Probabilistic weather forecasts, especially for tropical weather, is still a significant challenge for global weather forecasting systems. Expressing uncertainty along with weather forecasts is important for informed decision making. Hence, we explore the use of a relatively new approach in using super‐parameterization, where a cloud resolving model is embedded within a global model, in probabilistic tropical weather forecasts at medium range. We show that this approach helps improve modeling uncertainty in forecasts of certain features such as precipitation magnitude and location better, but forecasts of tropical winds are not necessarily improved. Ensemble superparameterization is used for model uncertainty representation in probabilistic weather prediction We compare probabilistic forecasts with stochastic parameterization versus ensemble superparameterization for tropical convective systems Nature of convective error growth in a multiscale ensemble modeling framework is studied}},

   Plain Language Summary Weather and climate models cannot represent
   physical processes of the Earth System explicitly that are smaller than
   the distance between model grid points. Due to limitations in computing
   power, this distance is typically larger than 10 km in simulations of
   the global atmosphere. However, the spatial scale for many important
   physical processes, such as clouds, is much smaller than this and large
   errors are generated for predictions of both weather and climate due to
   limited resolution. To approximate the behavior of subgrid-scale
   processes within atmosphere models, superparameterization was developed
   that is running a two-dimensional small-scale model within each grid
   column of the global model. Superparameterization can improve model
   simulations but it causes a very large increase in computational cost in
   comparison to standard simulations. To reduce computational cost, this
   paper investigates whether it is possible to reduce numerical precision
   when running the small-scale model. It is shown that precision can
   indeed be reduced such that computing costs can potentially be reduced
   significantly. It is also shown that results of an investigation of
   reduced numerical precision provide valuable information for the
   quantification of model uncertainty and model development.}},

Understanding links between climate variability and landfalling ARs is critical for improving forecasts on timescales needed for water resource management. We examined 69 years of landfalling ARs along western North America using reanalysis and a long‐term AR catalog to identify circulation drivers of AR landfalls. This analysis reveals that AR activity along the West Coast is largely associated with a handful of influential modes of atmospheric variability. Interaction between these modes creates favorable or unfavorable atmospheric states for landfalling ARs at different locations, effectively steering moisture plumes up and down the coast from Mexico to British Columbia. Seasonal persistence of certain modes helps explain interannual variability of landfalling ARs, including recent California drought years and the wet winter of 2016/2017. Understanding links between large‐scale climate variability and landfalling ARs is important for improving subseasonal‐to‐seasonal (S2S) predictability of water resources in the western United States. We have analyzed a seven‐decade‐long catalog of ARs impacting western North America to quantify synoptic influence on AR activity. Our results identify dominant circulation patterns associated with landfalling ARs and show how seasonal variation in the prevalence of certain circulation features modulates the frequency of AR landfalls at different latitudes in a given year. AR variability played an important role in the recent California drought as well as the wet winter of 2016/2017, and we show how this variability was associated with the relative frequency of favorable versus unfavorable atmospheric states. Our findings also reveal that the bulk of AR landfalls along the West Coast is associated with only a handful of influential circulation features, which has implications for S2S predictability.

   two open-source community model components: the MITgcm ocean model and

   coupling between these components is performed using ESMF (Earth System
   Modeling Framework) and implemented according to National United
   Operational Prediction Capability (NUOPC) protocols. The coupled model
   is named the Scripps-KAUST Regional Integrated Prediction System
   (SKRIPS). SKRIPS is demonstrated with a real-world example by simulating
   a 30 d period including a series of extreme heat events occurring on the
   eastern shore of the Red Sea region in June 2012. The results obtained
   by using the coupled model, along with those in forced stand-alone
   oceanic or atmospheric simulations, are compared with observational data
   and reanalysis products. We show that the coupled model is capable of
   performing coupled ocean-atmosphere simulations, although all
   configurations of coupled and uncoupled models have good skill in
   modeling the heat events. In addition, a scalability test is performed
   to investigate the parallelization of the coupled model. The results
   indicate that the coupled model code scales well and the ESMF/NUOPC
   coupler accounts for less than 5\% of the total computational resources

   Nina events occur more often in the 1980s and 1990s while in the past
   two decades there have been fewer extreme events in the Tropical
   Pacific. We also find that the strongest easterly wind anomalies occur

   seasons. When the RW effect is taken into account in the high-resolution
   SCOAR (WRF-ROMS) regional coupled model simulation and compared to the
   run without such a consideration, the kinetic energy both in the mean

   significant reduction in the kinetic energy is found along the path of
   the northward East India Coastal Current (EICC) and to the south of its
   separated latitude. The energetics calculations and spectral analysis
   reveal that this significant damping of EKE is primarily due to reduced
   eddy wind work principally at wavelengths close to the first baroclinic
   Rossby deformation radius, indicating the modulation of the wind work by
   geostrophic mesoscale eddy fields. Moreover, the mixed layer depth (MLD)
   is significantly shoaled south of the separated EICC latitude, the area
   dominated by anticyclonic eddy activity. The shallower mixed layer and
   enhanced stratification with the RW effect are attributed to doming of

   generated by the interaction of anticyclonic mesoscale surface current
   and the prevailing southwesterly monsoonal wind. Overall, the

abstract = {{Numerical weather prediction and climate models comprise a) a dynamical    core describing resolved parts of the climate system and b)
   parameterizations describing unresolved components. Development of new
   subgrid-scale parameterizations is particularly uncertain compared to
   representing resolved scales in the dynamical core. This uncertainty is
   currently represented by stochastic approaches in several operational
   weather models, which will inevitably percolate into the dynamical core.
   Hence, implementing dynamical cores with excessive numerical accuracy
   will not bring forecast gains, may even hinder them since valuable
   computer resources will be tied up doing insignificant computation, and
   therefore cannot be deployed for more useful gains, such as increasing
   model resolution or ensemble sizes. Here we describe a low-cost
   stochastic scheme that can be implemented in any existing deterministic
   dynamical core as an additive noise term. This scheme could be used to
   adjust accuracy in future dynamical core development work. We propose
   that such an additive stochastic noise test case should become a part of
   the routine testing and development of dynamical cores in a stochastic
   framework. The overall key point of the study is that we should not
   develop dynamical cores that are more precise than the level of
   uncertainty provided by our stochastic scheme. In this way, we present a
   new paradigm for dynamical core development work, ensuring that weather
   and climate models become more computationally efficient. We show some
   results based on tests done with the European Centre for Medium-Range

   internal variability of the climate system and changes in external
   radiative forcing. The degree to which either of the two factors
   contributed to EW and MC, or both, is still debated. Using a two-box
   impulse response model, we demonstrate that multidecadal ocean
   variability was unlikely to be the driver of observed changes in global
   mean surface temperature (GMST) after AD 1850. Instead, virtually all
   (97\%-98\textbackslash\%) of the global low-frequency variability (>30 years) can be
   explained by external forcing. We find similarly high percentages of
   explained variance for interhemispheric and land-ocean temperature
   evolution. Three key aspects are identified that underpin the conclusion
   of this new study: inhomogeneous anthropogenic aerosol forcing (AER),
   biases in the instrumental sea surface temperature (SST) datasets, and
   inadequate representation of the response to varying forcing factors.
   Once the spatially heterogeneous nature of AER is accounted for, the MC
   period is reconcilable with external drivers. SST biases and imprecise
   forcing responses explain the putative disagreement between models and
   observations during the EW period. As a consequence, Atlantic
   multidecadal variability (AMV) is found to be primarily controlled by
   external forcing too. Future attribution studies should account for
   these important factors when discriminating between externally forced
   and internally generated influences on climate. We argue that AMV must
   not be used as a regressor and suggest a revised AMV index instead
   [the North Atlantic Variability Index (NAVI)]. Our associated best
   estimate for the transient climate response (TCR) is 1.57 K (+/- 0.70 at

abstract = {{Stochastic parameterizations account for uncertainty in the    representation of unresolved subgrid processes by sampling from the
   distribution of possible subgrid forcings. Some existing stochastic
   parameterizations utilize data-driven approaches to characterize
   uncertainty, but these approaches require significant structural
   assumptions that can limit their scalability. Machine learning models,
   including neural networks, are able to represent a wide range of
   distributions and build optimized mappings between a large number of
   inputs and subgrid forcings. Recent research on machine learning
   parameterizations has focused only on deterministic parameterizations.
   In this study, we develop a stochastic parameterization using the
   generative adversarial network (GAN) machine learning framework. The GAN
   stochastic parameterization is trained and evaluated on output from the
   Lorenz `96 model, which is a common baseline model for evaluating both
   parameterization and data assimilation techniques. We evaluate different
   ways of characterizing the input noise for the model and perform model
   runs with the GAN parameterization at weather and climate time scales.
   Some of the GAN configurations perform better than a baseline bespoke
   parameterization at both time scales, and the networks closely reproduce
   the spatiotemporal correlations and regimes of the Lorenz `96 system. We
   also find that, in general, those models which produce skillful
   forecasts are also associated with the best climate simulations.
   Plain Language Summary Simulations of the atmosphere must approximate
   the effects of small-scale processes with simplified functions called
   parameterizations. Standard parameterizations only predict one output
   for a given input, but stochastic parameterizations can sample from all
   the possible outcomes that can occur under certain conditions. We have
   developed and evaluated a machine learning stochastic parameterization,
   which builds a mapping between large-scale current conditions and the
   range of small-scale outcomes from data about both. We test the machine
   learning stochastic parameterization in a simplified mathematical
   simulation that produces multiscale chaotic waves like the atmosphere.
   We find that some configurations of the machine learning stochastic
   parameterization perform slightly better than a simpler baseline
   stochastic parameterization over both weather- and climate-like time

   for the cloud parameters of the NCAR Single Column Atmosphere Model
   (SCAM6) using surrogate models based on a polynomial chaos expansion.
   The use of a surrogate model enables to efficiently propagate
   uncertainties in parameters into uncertainties in model outputs. We
   investigated eight uncertain parameters: the auto-conversion size
   threshold for ice to snow (dcs), the fall speed parameter for stratiform
   cloud ice (ai), the fall speed parameter for stratiform snow (as), the
   fall speed parameter for cloud water (ac), the collection efficiency of
   aggregation ice (eii), the efficiency factor of the Bergeron effect
   (berg\_eff), the threshold maximum relative humidity for ice clouds
   (rhmaxi), and the threshold minimum relative humidity for ice clouds
   (rhmini). We built two surrogate models using two non-intrusive methods:
   spectral projection (SP) and basis pursuit denoising (BPDN). Our results
   suggest that BPDN performs better than SP as it enables to filter out
   internal noise during the process of fitting the surrogate model. Five
   out of the eight parameters (namely dcs, ai, rhmaxi, rhmini, and eii)
   account for most of the variance in predicted climate variables (e.g.,
   total precipitation, cloud distribution, shortwave and longwave cloud
   radiative effect, ice, and liquid water path). A first-order sensitivity
   analysis reveals that dcs contributes similar to 40-80\% of the total
   variance of the climate variables, ai around 15-30\textbackslash\%, and rhmaxi,
   rhmini, and eii around 5-15\textbackslash\%. The second- and higher-order effects
   contribute similar to 7 and 20\textbackslash\%, respectively. The sensitivity of the
   model to these parameters was further explored using response curves. A
   Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) sampling algorithm was also implemented
   for the Bayesian inference of dcs, ai, as, rhmini, and berg\textbackslash\_eff using
   cloud distribution data collected at the Southern Great Plains (USA).

   in the National Center for Atmospheric Research Community Earth System
   Model version 2 (CESM2) with a particular focus on upper ocean
   properties and air-sea interaction processes. We show that the CESM2 has
   warm and fresh surface biases in the tropical Pacific Ocean, a barrier
   layer that is too thin in the WP, and an isothermal layer depth (ILD)
   that is too deep in the eastern Pacific (EP). These biases impact
   air-sea interaction processes involved in El Nino development. We
   compare the strong El Nino events in ORAS5 and CESM2 and show that
   biases in barrier layer thickness in the WP and in ILD in the EP are
   significant before the onset of the El Nino events. These biases then
   influence vertical mixing and entrainment processes, resulting in mixed
   layer cooling biases. Biases in the sea surface temperature seasonal
   cycle in the CESM2 also influence the development of the El Nino. We
   emphasize how the El Nino progression in models can be influenced by its
   sensitivity to the mean state biases in both subsurface ocean structure
   and seasonal cycle through local as well as the large-scale physical

   region. Validation data shows that the coupled model skillfully
   reproduces the evolving SST, as well as the surface turbulent heat
   transfers between the ocean and atmosphere. The roles of air-sea
   interactions in AR events are investigated by comparing coupled model
   hindcasts to hindcasts made using persistent SST. To evaluate the

   Plain Language Summary Atmospheric rivers (ARs) play a key role in
   extreme precipitation along the west coast of North America. Because of
   their important societal impact, an improved understanding of ARs is
   critical. In the present work, we use a coupled ocean-atmosphere
   modeling system to investigate the role of air-sea interactions in
   simulating ARs. We highlight two groups in our simulations for which the
   ocean's response to ARs differs. One group is associated with strong
   ocean cooling, where the ocean cools everywhere. The other group is
   associated with weak ocean cooling, where the ARs can warm part of the
   ocean. We investigate the AR water vapor content and transport to
   evaluate the ocean's impact on ARs. We find that the coupled model
   better simulates the air-sea exchanges and AR water vapor content. The
   improvements are more significant during the AR events associated with
   strong ocean cooling.}},

   forced with SST and SIC from the sea ice melt experiments, the ISM
   circulation weakened substantially, and the monsoon low-pressure systems
   (LPS) activity experienced an overall decline of 23\%, with a widespread
   weakening in the south and a moderate strengthening over the north, in
   response to a decline of 78\textbackslash\% (24\textbackslash\%) in SIC over the Arctic (Antarctic)
   in the June-September season. The changes in the LPS activity in
   response to polar sea ice melt are found to be mostly driven by the
   changes in low-level absolute vorticity and vertical shear over the Bay
   of Bengal.
   Plain Language Summary The sea ice is melting rapidly in a warming
   climate, which can have feedback effects on the climate system. However,
   the impact of sea ice melt on low latitude climate is not adequately
   understood. The Indian summer monsoon (ISM), known as the lifeline of
   South Asia, is essential to the water security of more than 1.5 billion
   people. We examined the response of the ISM to the polar sea ice melt
   using a suite of global climate model experiments. Our simulations show
   that the monsoon circulation and rainfall weaken substantially due to
   the sea ice melt. Further, the number of propagating precipitating
   vortices embedded in the monsoon circulation declined by about 22\textbackslash\% in
   the sea ice melt experiments. Our results suggest that the Arctic and
   Antarctic sea ice melt could have severe implications for the water
   security of South Asia.}},

We find that the model MISO exhibits spatial structures and northward propagation characteristics broadly similar to observed MISO when confining the analysis to the 25–90 day period band. The MISO precipitation anomalies are then shown to be consistent with previously known observed relationships to broad-scale sea-level pressure patterns, Inter-Tropical Convergence Zone (ITCZ) positioning, and changes in the regional Hadley Cell component. The total simulated seasonal (JJAS) rainfall anomalies over India are not significantly correlated with observations, indicating that intrinsic variations in the regional model atmosphere dominate most of the precipitation variability. However, the bandpass-filtered MISO anomalies surprisingly exhibit a significant correlation (0.61) with observations. This suggests that instabilities in the regional broad-scale atmospheric circulation, e.g., linked to the ITCZ position or strength, may be partly controlled by the large-scale atmospheric flows specified at the domain boundaries and/or that specified local SST anomalies may help to guide some fraction of the developing model MISO to follow observations. This result motivates further research on MISO initiation and development using this type of regional atmospheric model.}},

   on average and are slightly nonbeneficial when taken late in the DA

   drifting buoys deployed under the AR Reconnaissance project reduce
   forecast errors at 72 and 96 h over North America and the Northern

   scales. We introduce an experimental forecast tool that uses observed
   anomaly patterns during a 38 yr period to predict the probability of
   above- and below-normal AR activity and precipitation at lead times of
   1-6 weeks based on the phase and amplitude of the MJO and QBO. The
   hindcast prediction skill of probabilistic AR activity and precipitation
   forecasts is evaluated for Northern, Central, and Southern California,
   as well as two sets of smaller geographical domains. These smaller
   domains are more relevant for water resource management and allow us to
   investigate the sensitivity of prediction skill to domain size.
   Consistent with previous studies, our results demonstrate that
   subseasonal AR activity and precipitation in California are strongly
   modulated by the MJO and QBO. The anomaly patterns of AR activity and
   precipitation vary considerably throughout the cool season, with a
   tendency toward below-normal AR activity and precipitation during
   easterly QBO and above-normal AR activity and precipitation during
   westerly QBO in JFM. The opposite patterns are generally observed in
   OND, but the anomaly signals are weaker and less coherent for AR

   season yield notably higher skill scores, reinforcing the notion of
   ``windows of opportunity `` for skillful subseasonal-to-seasonal
   predictions. In California, these forecasts of opportunity are
   predominantly associated with easterly QBO in JFM and FMA.}},

abstract = {{Despite the well-recognized initial value nature of the subseasonal    forecasts, the role of subsurface ocean initialization in subseasonal
   forecasts remains underexplored. Using observing system experiments,
   this study investigates the impact of ocean in situ data assimilation on
   the propagation of Madden-Julian Oscillation (MJO) events across the
   Maritime Continent in the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather
   Forecasts (ECMWF) subseasonal forecast system. Two sets of twin
   experiments are analyzed, which only differ on the use or not of in situ
   ocean observations in the initial conditions. Besides using the
   Real-time Multivariate MJO Index (RMMI) to evaluate the forecast
   performance, we also develop a new MJO tracking method based on outgoing
   longwave radiation anomalies (OLRa) for forecast evaluation. We find
   that the ocean initialization with in situ data assimilation, though
   having an impact on the forecasted ocean mean state, does not improve
   the relatively low MJO forecast skill across the Maritime Continent.
   Moist static energy budget analysis further suggests that a significant
   underestimation in the meridional moisture advection in the model
   forecast may hinder the potential role played by the ocean state
   differences associated with data assimilation. Bias of the intraseasonal
   meridional winds in the model is a more important factor for such
   underestimation than the mean state moisture biases. This finding
   suggests that atmospheric model biases dominate the forecast error
   growth, and the atmospheric circulation bias is one of the major sources
   of the MJO prediction error and should be a target for improving the
   ECMWF subseasonal forecast model.}},

abstract = {{Modern climate models use both deterministic and stochastic    parametrization schemes to represent uncertainties in their physics and
   inputs. This work considers the problem of estimating the involved
   parameters of such systems simultaneously with their state through data
   assimilation. Standard state-parameter filtering schemes cannot be
   applied to such systems, owing to the posterior dependence between the
   stochastic parameters and the ``dynamical'' augmented state, defined
   as the state augmented by the deterministic parameters. We resort to the
   variational Bayesian (VB) approach to break this dependence, by
   approximating the joint posterior probability density function (pdf) of
   the augmented state and the stochastic parameters with a separable
   product of two marginal pdfs that minimizes the Kullback-Leibler
   divergence. The resulting marginal pdf of the augmented state is then
   sampled using a one-step-ahead smoothing-based ensemble Kalman filter
   (EnKF-OSAS), whereas a closed form is derived for the marginal pdf of
   the stochastic parameters. The proposed approach combines the
   effectiveness of the OSAS filtering approach to mitigate inconsistency
   issues that often arise with the joint ensemble Kalman filter (EnKF),
   with the advantage of obtaining a full posterior pdf for the stochastic
   parameters, which is not possible with the traditional
   maximum-likelihood method. We demonstrate the relevance of the proposed
   approach through extensive numerical experiments with a one-scale
   Lorenz-96 model, which includes a stochastic parametrization
   representing subgrid-scale effects.}},
