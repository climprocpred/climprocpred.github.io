abstract: Ocean surface winds, currents, and waves play a crucial role in    exchanges
  of momentum, energy, heat, freshwater, gases, and other tracers between the ocean,
  atmosphere, and ice. Despite surface waves being strongly coupled to the upper ocean
  circulation and the overlying atmosphere, efforts to improve ocean, atmospheric,
  and wave observations and models have evolved somewhat independently. From an observational
  point of view, community efforts to bridge this gap have led to proposals for satellite
  Doppler oceanography mission concepts, which could provide unprecedented measurements
  of absolute surface velocity and directional wave spectrum at global scales. This
  paper reviews the present state of observations of surface winds, currents, and
  waves, and it outlines observational gaps that limit our current understanding of
  coupled processes that happen at the air-sea-ice interface. A significant challenge
  for the coming decade of wind, current, and wave observations will come in combining
  and interpreting measurements from (a) wave-buoys and high-frequency radars in coastal
  regions, (b) surface drifters and wave-enabled drifters in the open-ocean, marginal
  ice zones, and wave-current interaction ``hot-spots,'' and (c) simultaneous measurements
  of absolute surface currents, ocean surface wind vector, and directional wave spectrum
  from Doppler satellite sensors.
