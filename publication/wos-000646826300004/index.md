abstract: Conventional observations of atmospheric rivers (ARs) over the    northeastern
  Pacific Ocean are sparse. Satellite radiances are affected by the presence of clouds
  and heavy precipitation, which impact their distribution in the lower atmosphere
  and in precipitating areas. The goal of this study is to document a data gap in
  existing observations of ARs in the northeastern Pacific, and to investigate how
  a targeted field campaign called AR Reconnaissance (AR Recon) can effectively fill
  this gap. When reconnaissance data are excluded, there is a gap in AR regions from
  near the surface to the middle troposphere (below 450 hPa), where most water vapor
  and its transport are concentrated. All-sky microwave radiances provide data within
  the AR object, but their quality is degraded near the AR core and its leading edge,
  due to the existence of thick clouds and precipitation. AR Recon samples ARs and
  surrounding areas to improve downstream precipitation forecasts over the western
  United States. This study demonstrates that despite the apparently extensive swaths
  of modern satellite radiances, which are critical to estimate large-scale flow,
  the data collected during 15 AR Recon cases in 2016, 2018, and 2019 supply about
  99% of humidity, 78 % of temperature, and 45 % of wind observations in the critical
  maximum water vapor transport layer from the ocean surface to 700 hPa in ARs. The
  high-vertical-resolution dropsonde observations in the lower atmosphere over the
  northeastern Pacific Ocean can significantly improve the sampling of low-level jets
  transporting water vapor to high-impact precipitation events in the western United
  States.
