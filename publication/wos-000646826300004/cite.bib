 abstract = {Conventional observations of atmospheric rivers (ARs) over the    northeastern Pacific Ocean are sparse. Satellite radiances are affected
by the presence of clouds and heavy precipitation, which impact their
distribution in the lower atmosphere and in precipitating areas. The
goal of this study is to document a data gap in existing observations of
ARs in the northeastern Pacific, and to investigate how a targeted field
campaign called AR Reconnaissance (AR Recon) can effectively fill this
gap. When reconnaissance data are excluded, there is a gap in AR regions
from near the surface to the middle troposphere (below 450 hPa), where
most water vapor and its transport are concentrated. All-sky microwave
radiances provide data within the AR object, but their quality is
degraded near the AR core and its leading edge, due to the existence of
thick clouds and precipitation. AR Recon samples ARs and surrounding
areas to improve downstream precipitation forecasts over the western
United States. This study demonstrates that despite the apparently
extensive swaths of modern satellite radiances, which are critical to
estimate large-scale flow, the data collected during 15 AR Recon cases
in 2016, 2018, and 2019 supply about 99% of humidity, 78\ % of
temperature, and 45\ % of wind observations in the critical maximum water
vapor transport layer from the ocean surface to 700 hPa in ARs. The
high-vertical-resolution dropsonde observations in the lower atmosphere
over the northeastern Pacific Ocean can significantly improve the
sampling of low-level jets transporting water vapor to high-impact
precipitation events in the western United States.},
