abstract: Stochastic schemes to represent model uncertainty in the European Centre
  for Medium‐Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF) ensemble prediction system has helped
  improve its probabilistic forecast skill over the past decade by both improving
  its reliability and reducing the ensemble mean error. The largest uncertainties
  in the model arise from the model physics parameterizations. In the tropics, the
  parameterization of moist convection presents a major challenge for the accurate
  prediction of weather and climate. Superparameterization is a promising alternative
  strategy for including the effects of moist convection through explicit turbulent
  fluxes calculated from a cloud‐resolving model (CRM) embedded within a global climate
  model (GCM). In this paper, we compare the impact of initial random perturbations
  in embedded CRMs, within the ECMWF ensemble prediction system, with stochastically
  perturbed physical tendency (SPPT) scheme as a way to represent model uncertainty
  in medium‐range tropical weather forecasts. We especially focus on forecasts of
  tropical convection and dynamics during MJO events in October–November 2011. These
  are well‐studied events for MJO dynamics as they were also heavily observed during
  the DYNAMO field campaign. We show that a multiscale ensemble modeling approach
  helps improve forecasts of certain aspects of tropical convection during the MJO
  events, while it also tends to deteriorate certain large‐scale dynamic fields with
  respect to stochastically perturbed physical tendencies approach that is used operationally
  at ECMWF. Probabilistic weather forecasts, especially for tropical weather, is still
  a significant challenge for global weather forecasting systems. Expressing uncertainty
  along with weather forecasts is important for informed decision making. Hence, we
  explore the use of a relatively new approach in using super‐parameterization, where
  a cloud resolving model is embedded within a global model, in probabilistic tropical
  weather forecasts at medium range. We show that this approach helps improve modeling
  uncertainty in forecasts of certain features such as precipitation magnitude and
  location better, but forecasts of tropical winds are not necessarily improved. Ensemble
  superparameterization is used for model uncertainty representation in probabilistic
  weather prediction We compare probabilistic forecasts with stochastic parameterization
  versus ensemble superparameterization for tropical convective systems Nature of
  convective error growth in a multiscale ensemble modeling framework is studied
