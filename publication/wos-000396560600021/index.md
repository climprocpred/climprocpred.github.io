abstract: Uncertainties in parametrized processes in general circulation models    can
  be represented as stochastic perturbations to the model formulation. The European
  Centre for MediumRange Weather Forecasts (ECMWF) has pioneered approaches to represent
  these model errors in forecasting systems. In particular, the stochastically perturbed
  physical tendency (SPPT) scheme for the atmosphere is used in their operational
  ensemble system for mediumand long-range predictions. Recent studies have shown
  that these stochastic approaches can both increase the reliability of the probabilistic
  forecasts and reduce long-term mean biases of themodel climate. Towards developing
  a seamless prediction system in the future, these benefits of stochastic parametrization
  for both short-term and long-term forecasts make it an essential component of the
  next generation Earth System models. We present results of the impact of different
  configurations of the SPPT scheme in ECMWF's seasonal forecasting System 4 on the
  mean and variability in tropical precipitation. Small-scale perturbations in the
  SPPT scheme play a significant role in reducing the mean biases in tropical precipitation.
  The stochastic physics also nonlinearly rectify the convection and precipitation
  during different phases of El Nino Southern Oscillation events and improve the reliability
  of the ensemble forecasts for the Madden-Julian Oscillation (MJO). They impact the
  MJO dynamics by modulating the convective and suppressed phases of the MJO. Finally,
  we discuss some of the caveats to this analysis and some future prospects.
