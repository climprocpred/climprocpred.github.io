 abstract = {This study examines the effect of surface current in the bulk formula    for the wind stress, referred to as the relative wind (RW) effect, on
the energetics of the geostrophic circulation and the upper ocean
stratification in the Bay of Bengal (BoB) during the summer monsoon
seasons. When the RW effect is taken into account in the high-resolution
SCOAR (WRF-ROMS) regional coupled model simulation and compared to the
run without such a consideration, the kinetic energy both in the mean
(MICE) and eddy (EKE) is reduced by more than a factor of two. The most
significant reduction in the kinetic energy is found along the path of
the northward East India Coastal Current (EICC) and to the south of its
separated latitude. The energetics calculations and spectral analysis
reveal that this significant damping of EKE is primarily due to reduced
eddy wind work principally at wavelengths close to the first baroclinic
Rossby deformation radius, indicating the modulation of the wind work by
geostrophic mesoscale eddy fields. Moreover, the mixed layer depth (MLD)
is significantly shoaled south of the separated EICC latitude, the area
dominated by anticyclonic eddy activity. The shallower mixed layer and
enhanced stratification with the RW effect are attributed to doming of
the isopycnals by the anomalous upward Ekman velocity, which itself is
generated by the interaction of anticyclonic mesoscale surface current
and the prevailing southwesterly monsoonal wind. Overall, the
geostrophic circulation and upper ocean stratification along the EICC
and south of its separated latitude exhibit the most significant
dynamical response. This result implies that this southwestern part of
the BoB is a hot spot for the momentum exchange between the surface
circulation and the monsoonal winds, thus a potential area for focused
field measurements for the ocean circulation energetics and air-sea
interaction.},
