abstract: Predictability of Atlantic Ocean sea surface temperatures (SST) on    seasonal
  and decadal timescales is investigated using a suite of statistical linear inverse
  models (LIM). Observed monthly SST anomalies in the Atlantic sector (between 22S
  and 66N) are used to construct the LIMs for seasonal and decadal prediction. The
  forecast skills of the LIMs are then compared to that from two current operational
  forecast systems. Results indicate that the LIM has good forecast skill for time
  periods of 3-4 months on the seasonal timescale with enhanced predictability in
  the spring season. On decadal timescales, the impact of inter-annual and intra-annual
  variability on the predictability is also investigated. The results show that the
  suite of LIMs have forecast skill for about 3-4 years over most of the domain when
  we use only the decadal variability for the construction of the LIM. Including higher
  frequency variability helps improve the forecast skill and maintains the correlation
  of LIM predictions with the observed SST anomalies for longer periods. These results
  indicate the importance of temporal scale interactions in improving predictability
  on decadal timescales. Hence, LIMs can not only be used as benchmarks for estimates
  of statistical skill but also to isolate contributions to the forecast skills from
  different timescales, spatial scales or even model components.
