 abstract = {Quantifying uncertainty associated with our models is the only way we    can express how much we know about any phenomenon. Incomplete
consideration of model-based uncertainties can lead to overstated
conclusions with real-world impacts in diverse spheres, including
conservation, epidemiology, climate science, and policy. Despite these
potentially damaging consequences, we still know little about how
different fields quantify and report uncertainty. We introduce the
``sources of uncertainty'' framework, using it to conduct a systematic
audit of model-related uncertainty quantification from seven scientific
fields, spanning the biological, physical, and political sciences. Our
interdisciplinary audit shows no field fully considers all possible
sources of uncertainty, but each has its own best practices alongside
shared outstanding challenges. We make ten easy-to-implement
recommendations to improve the consistency, completeness, and clarity of
reporting on model-related uncertainty. These recommendations serve as a
guide to best practices across scientific fields and expand our toolbox
for high-quality research.},
