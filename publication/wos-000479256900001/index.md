abstract: Subseasonal-to-seasonal (S2S) forecasts have the potential to provide    advance
  information about weather and climate events. The high heat capacity of water means
  that the subsurface ocean stores and re-releases heat (and other properties) and
  is an important source of information for S2S forecasts. However, the subsurface
  ocean is challenging to observe, because it cannot be measured by satellite. Subsurface
  ocean observing systems relevant for understanding, modeling, and forecasting on
  S2S timescales will continue to evolve with the improvement in technological capabilities.
  The community must focus on designing and implementing low-cost, high-value surface
  and subsurface ocean observations, and developing forecasting system capable of
  extracting their observation potential in forecast applications. S2S forecasts will
  benefit significantly from higher spatio-temporal resolution data in regions that
  are sources of predictability on these timescales (coastal, tropical, and polar
  regions). While ENSO has been a driving force for the design of the current observing
  system, the subseasonal time scales present new observational requirements. Advanced
  observation technologies such as autonomous surface and subsurface profiling devices
  as well as satellites that observe the ocean-atmosphere interface simultaneously
  can lead to breakthroughs in coupled data assimilation (CDA) and coupled initialization
  for S2S forecasts.
