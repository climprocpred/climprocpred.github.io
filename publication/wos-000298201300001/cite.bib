 abstract = {This study assesses the ability of the Community Climate System Model,    version 4 (CCSM4) to represent the Madden-Julian oscillation (MJO), the
dominant mode of intraseasonal variability in the tropical atmosphere.
The U.S. Climate Variability and Predictability (CLIVAR) MJO Working
Group's prescribed diagnostic tests are used to evaluate the model's
mean state, variance, and wavenumber frequency characteristics in a
20-yr simulation of the intraseasonal variability in zonal winds at 850
hPa (U850) and 200 hPa (U200), and outgoing longwave radiation (OLR).
Unlike its predecessor, CCSM4 reproduces a number of aspects of MJO
behavior more realistically.
The CCSM4 produces coherent, broadbanded, and energetic patterns in
eastward-propagating intraseasonal zonal winds and OLR in the tropical
Indian and Pacific Oceans that are generally consistent with MJO
characteristics. Strong peaks occur in power spectra and coherence
spectra with periods between 20 and 100 days and zonal wavenumbers
between 1 and 3. Model MJOs, however, tend to be more broadbanded in
frequency than in observations. Broad-scale patterns, as revealed in
combined EOFs of U850, U200, and OLR, are remarkably consistent with
observations and indicate that large-scale convergence convection
coupling occurs in the simulated MJO.
Relations between MJO in the model and its concurrence with other
climate states are also explored. MJO activity (defined as the
percentage of time the MJO index exceeds 1.5) is enhanced during El Nino
events compared to La Nina events, both in the model and observations.
MJO activity is increased during periods of anomalously strong negative
meridional wind shear in the Asian monsoon region and also during strong
negative Indian Ocean zonal mode states, in both the model and
observations.},
