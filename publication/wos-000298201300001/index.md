abstract: This study assesses the ability of the Community Climate System Model,    version
  4 (CCSM4) to represent the Madden-Julian oscillation (MJO), the dominant mode of
  intraseasonal variability in the tropical atmosphere. The U.S. Climate Variability
  and Predictability (CLIVAR) MJO Working Group's prescribed diagnostic tests are
  used to evaluate the model's mean state, variance, and wavenumber frequency characteristics
  in a 20-yr simulation of the intraseasonal variability in zonal winds at 850 hPa
  (U850) and 200 hPa (U200), and outgoing longwave radiation (OLR). Unlike its predecessor,
  CCSM4 reproduces a number of aspects of MJO behavior more realistically. The CCSM4
  produces coherent, broadbanded, and energetic patterns in eastward-propagating intraseasonal
  zonal winds and OLR in the tropical Indian and Pacific Oceans that are generally
  consistent with MJO characteristics. Strong peaks occur in power spectra and coherence
  spectra with periods between 20 and 100 days and zonal wavenumbers between 1 and
  3. Model MJOs, however, tend to be more broadbanded in frequency than in observations.
  Broad-scale patterns, as revealed in combined EOFs of U850, U200, and OLR, are remarkably
  consistent with observations and indicate that large-scale convergence convection
  coupling occurs in the simulated MJO. Relations between MJO in the model and its
  concurrence with other climate states are also explored. MJO activity (defined as
  the percentage of time the MJO index exceeds 1.5) is enhanced during El Nino events
  compared to La Nina events, both in the model and observations. MJO activity is
  increased during periods of anomalously strong negative meridional wind shear in
  the Asian monsoon region and also during strong negative Indian Ocean zonal mode
  states, in both the model and observations.
