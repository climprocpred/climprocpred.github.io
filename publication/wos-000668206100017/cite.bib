 abstract = {Using a high-resolution atmospheric general circulation model simulation    of unprecedented ensemble size, we examine potential predictability of
monthly anomalies under El Nino-Southern Oscillation (ENSO) forcing and
background internal variability. This study reveals the pronounced
month-to-month evolution of both the ENSO forcing signal and internal
variability. Internal variance in upper-level geopotential height
decreases (similar to 10%) over the North Pacific during El Nino as the
westerly jet extends eastward, allowing forced signals to account for a
greater fraction of the total variability, and leading to increased
potential predictability. We identify February and March of El Nino
years as the most predictable months using a signal-to-noise analysis.
In contrast, December, a month typically included in teleconnection
studies, shows little to no potential predictability. We show that the
seasonal evolution of SST forcing and variability leads to significant
signal-to-noise relationships that can be directly linked to both
upper-level and surface variable predictability for a given month. The
stark changes in forced response, internal variability, and thus
signal-to-noise across an ENSO season indicate that subseasonal fields
should be used to diagnose potential predictability over North America
associated with ENSO teleconnections. Using surface air temperature and
precipitation as examples, this study provides motivation to pursue
``windows of forecast opportunity'' in which statistical skill can be
developed, tested, and leveraged to determine times and regions in which
this skill may be elevated.},
