 abstract = {This study investigates the filtering problem with one-way coupled (OWC)    state-space systems, for which the joint ensemble Kalman filter (EnKF)
is the standard solution. In this approach, the states of the two
coupled sub-systems are jointly updated with all incoming observations.
This enables transfer of the information across the sub-systems, which
should provide coupled-state estimates in better agreement with the
observations. The state estimates of the joint EnKF highly depend on the
relevance of the joint ensembles' cross-covariances between the
sub-systems' variables. In this work, we propose a new joint EnKF scheme
based on the One-Step-Ahead (OSA) smoothing formulation of the filtering
problem for efficient assimilation into OWC systems. The scheme
introduces an extra smoothing step for both states' sub-systems with the
future observations, followed by an analysis step for each sub-system
state using only its own observation, all within a Bayesian-consistent
framework. The extra OSA smoothing step enables us to more efficiently
exploit the observations, to enhance the representativeness of the EnKF
covariances, and to mitigate for reported inconsistencies in the joint
EnKF analysis step. We demonstrate the relevance of the proposed
approach by presenting and analyzing results of various numerical
experiments conducted with a OWC Lorenz-96 model.},
