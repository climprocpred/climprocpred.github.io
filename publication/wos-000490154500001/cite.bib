 abstract = {Many coastal areas host rich marine ecosystems and are also centers of    economic activities, including fishing, shipping and recreation. Due to
the socioeconomic and ecological importance of these areas, predicting
relevant indicators of the ecosystem state on sub-seasonal to
interannual timescales is gaining increasing attention. Depending on the
application, forecasts may be sought for variables and indicators
spanning physics (e.g., sea level, temperature, currents), chemistry
(e.g., nutrients, oxygen, pH), and biology (from viruses to top
predators). Many components of the marine ecosystem are known to be
influenced by leading modes of climate variability, which provide a
physical basis for predictability. However, prediction capabilities
remain limited by the lack of a clear understanding of the physical and
biological processes involved, as well as by insufficient observations
for forecast initialization and verification. The situation is further
complicated by the influence of climate change on ocean conditions along
coastal areas, including sea level rise, increased stratification, and
shoaling of oxygen minimum zones. Observations are thus vital to all
aspects of marine forecasting: statistical and/or dynamical model
development, forecast initialization, and forecast validation, each of
which has different observational requirements, which may be also
specific to the study region. Here, we use examples from United States
(U.S.) coastal applications to identify and describe the key
requirements for an observational network that is needed to facilitate
improved process understanding, as well as for sustaining operational
ecosystem forecasting. We also describe new holistic observational
approaches, e.g., approaches based on acoustics, inspired by Tara Oceans
or by landscape ecology, which have the potential to support and expand
ecosystem modeling and forecasting activities by bridging global and
local observations.},
