abstract: 'Many coastal areas host rich marine ecosystems and are also centers of    economic
  activities, including fishing, shipping and recreation. Due to the socioeconomic
  and ecological importance of these areas, predicting relevant indicators of the
  ecosystem state on sub-seasonal to interannual timescales is gaining increasing
  attention. Depending on the application, forecasts may be sought for variables and
  indicators spanning physics (e.g., sea level, temperature, currents), chemistry
  (e.g., nutrients, oxygen, pH), and biology (from viruses to top predators). Many
  components of the marine ecosystem are known to be influenced by leading modes of
  climate variability, which provide a physical basis for predictability. However,
  prediction capabilities remain limited by the lack of a clear understanding of the
  physical and biological processes involved, as well as by insufficient observations
  for forecast initialization and verification. The situation is further complicated
  by the influence of climate change on ocean conditions along coastal areas, including
  sea level rise, increased stratification, and shoaling of oxygen minimum zones.
  Observations are thus vital to all aspects of marine forecasting: statistical and/or
  dynamical model development, forecast initialization, and forecast validation, each
  of which has different observational requirements, which may be also specific to
  the study region. Here, we use examples from United States (U.S.) coastal applications
  to identify and describe the key requirements for an observational network that
  is needed to facilitate improved process understanding, as well as for sustaining
  operational ecosystem forecasting. We also describe new holistic observational approaches,
  e.g., approaches based on acoustics, inspired by Tara Oceans or by landscape ecology,
  which have the potential to support and expand ecosystem modeling and forecasting
  activities by bridging global and local observations.'
