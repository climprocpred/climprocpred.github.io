abstract: "This paper studies the statistical characteristics of a unique long-term\
  \    high-resolution precipitable water vapor (PWV) data set at Darwin, Australia,
  from 12 March 2002 to 28 February 2011. To understand the convective precipitation
  processes for climate model development, the U.S. Department of Energy's Atmospheric
  Radiation Measurement (ARM) program made high-frequency radar observations of PWV
  at the Darwin ARM site and released the best estimates from the radar data retrievals
  for this time period. Based on the best estimates, we produced a PWV data set on
  a uniform 20-s time grid. The gridded data were sufficient to show the fractal behavior
  of precipitable water with Hausdorff dimension equal to 1.9. Fourier power spectral
  analysis revealed modulation instability due to two sideband frequencies near the
  diurnal cycle, which manifests as nonlinearity of an atmospheric system. The statistics
  of PWV extreme values and daily rainfall data show that Darwin's PWV has El Nino
  Southern Oscillation (ENSO) signatures and has potential to be a predictor for weather
  forecasting. The right skewness of the PWV data was identified, which implies an
  important property of tropical atmosphere: ample capacity to hold water vapor. The
  statistical characteristics of this long-term high-resolution PWV data will facilitate
  the development and validation of climate models, particularly stochastic models."
