 abstract = {A suite of statistical linear inverse models (LIMs) are used to    understand the remote and local SST variability that influences SST
predictions over the North Pacific region. Observed monthly SST
anomalies in the Pacific are used to construct different regional LIMs
for seasonal to decadal predictions. The seasonal forecast skills of the
LIMs are compared to that from three operational forecast systems in the
North American Multi-Model Ensemble (NMME), revealing that the LIM has
better skill in the Northeastern Pacific than NMME models. The LIM is
also found to have comparable forecast skill for SST in the Tropical
Pacific with NMME models. This skill, however, is highly dependent on
the initialization month, with forecasts initialized during the summer
having better skill than those initialized during the winter. The data
are also bandpass filtered into seasonal, interannual and decadal time
scales to identify the relationships between time scales using the
structure of the propagator matrix. Moreover, we investigate the
influence of the tropics and extra-tropics in the predictability of the
SST over the region. The Extratropical North Pacific seems to be a
source of predictability for the tropics on seasonal to interannual time
scales, while the tropics enhance the forecast skill for the decadal
component. These results indicate the importance of temporal scale
interactions in improving the predictions on decadal timescales. Hence,
we show that LIMs are not only useful as benchmarks for estimates of
statistical skill, but also to isolate contributions to the forecast
skills from different timescales, spatial scales or even model
components.},
