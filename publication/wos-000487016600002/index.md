abstract: El Nino-Southern Oscillation (ENSO) is recognized as one of the    potentially
  predictable drivers of California Current System (CCS) variability. In this study,
  we analyze a 67-year coarse-resolution (similar to 1 degrees) simulation using the
  ocean model CESM-POP2-BEC forced by NCEP/NCAR reanalysis winds to develop a model
  composite of the physical-biological response of the CCS during ENSO events. The
  model results are also compared with available observations. The composite anomalies
  for sea surface temperature (SST), pycnocline depth, 0m-100m vertically averaged
  chlorophyll, 0m-100m vertically averaged zooplankton, 25m-100m vertically averaged
  nitrate, and oxygen at 200m depth exhibit large-scale coherent relationships between
  physics and the ecosystem, including reduced nutrient and plankton concentrations
  during El Nino, and increased nutrient and plankton concentrations during La Nina.
  However, the anomalous model response in temperature, chlorophyll, and zooplankton
  is generally much weaker than observed and includes a 1-2 month delay compared to
  observations. We also highlight the asymmetry in the model CCS response, where composite
  model La Nina events are stronger and more significant than model El Nino events,
  which is a feature previously identified in observations of CCS SST as well as in
  tropical Pacific Nino-4 SST where atmospheric teleconnections associated with ENSO
  are forced. These physical-biological composites provide a view of some of the limitations
  to the potentially predictable impacts of ENSO teleconnections on the CCS within
  the modeling framework of CESM-POP2-BEC.
