 abstract = {El Nino-Southern Oscillation (ENSO) is recognized as one of the    potentially predictable drivers of California Current System (CCS)
variability. In this study, we analyze a 67-year coarse-resolution
(similar to 1 degrees) simulation using the ocean model CESM-POP2-BEC
forced by NCEP/NCAR reanalysis winds to develop a model composite of the
physical-biological response of the CCS during ENSO events. The model
results are also compared with available observations. The composite
anomalies for sea surface temperature (SST), pycnocline depth, 0m-100m
vertically averaged chlorophyll, 0m-100m vertically averaged
zooplankton, 25m-100m vertically averaged nitrate, and oxygen at 200m
depth exhibit large-scale coherent relationships between physics and the
ecosystem, including reduced nutrient and plankton concentrations during
El Nino, and increased nutrient and plankton concentrations during La
Nina. However, the anomalous model response in temperature, chlorophyll,
and zooplankton is generally much weaker than observed and includes a
1-2 month delay compared to observations. We also highlight the
asymmetry in the model CCS response, where composite model La Nina
events are stronger and more significant than model El Nino events,
which is a feature previously identified in observations of CCS SST as
well as in tropical Pacific Nino-4 SST where atmospheric teleconnections
associated with ENSO are forced. These physical-biological composites
provide a view of some of the limitations to the potentially predictable
impacts of ENSO teleconnections on the CCS within the modeling framework
of CESM-POP2-BEC.},
