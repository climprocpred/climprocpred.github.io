 abstract = {Precipitation in California is highly variable and not well forecasted    on subseasonal-to-seasonal (S2S) timescales. Understanding relationships
between synoptic-scale atmospheric circulation and hydrometeorological
extremes could improve predictability. This work demonstrates the
importance of four North Pacific circulation regimes (called the NP4
modes) in modulating precipitation, flooding, and water resources in
California. Here we demonstrate how, on daily timescales, interactions
between the NP4 modes drive coastal flow that can result in dry
conditions from atmospheric ridging or wet conditions associated with
enhanced onshore flow and atmospheric river (AR) landfalls. Seasonally,
the prevalence of certain NP4 phase relationships can tip the scale
toward wet or dry conditions. Relationships between El Nino Southern
Oscillation (ENSO) and the NP4 are explored, and we provide insight into
the poorly forecasted Western US seasonal precipitation during the
``Godzilla'' El Nino winter of 2016 by examining climate-weather
linkages in a historical context.},
