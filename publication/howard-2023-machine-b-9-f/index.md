abstract: The accuracy of initial conditions is an important driver of the forecast
  skill of numerical weather prediction models. Increases in the quantity of available
  measurements, in particular high-resolution remote sensing observational data products
  from satellites, are valuable inputs for improving those initial condition estimates.
  However, the data assimilation methods used for integrating observations into forecast
  models are computationally expensive. This makes incorporating dense observations
  into operational forecast systems challenging, and it is often prohibitively time-consuming.
  As a result, large quantities of data are discarded and not used for state initialization.
  We demonstrate, using the Lorenz-96 system for testing, that a simple machine learning
  method can be trained to assimilate high-resolution data. Using it to do so improves
  both initial conditions and forecast accuracy. Compared to using the Ensemble Kalman
  Filter with high-resolution observations ignored, our augmented method has an average
  root-mean-squared error reduced by 15%. Ensemble forecasts using initial conditions
  generated by the augmented method are more accurate and reliable at up to 10 days
  of forecast lead time.
