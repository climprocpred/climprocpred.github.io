abstract: Marine ecosystem forecasting is an area of active research and rapid    development.
  Promise has been shown for skillful prediction of physical, biogeochemical, and
  ecological variables on a range of timescales, suggesting potential for forecasts
  to aid in the management of living marine resources and coastal communities. However,
  the mechanisms underlying forecast skill in marine ecosystems are often poorly understood,
  and many forecasts, especially for biological variables, rely on empirical statistical
  relationships developed from historical observations. Here, we review statistical
  and dynamical marine ecosystem forecasting methods and highlight examples of their
  application along U.S. coastlines for seasonal-to-interannual (1-24 month) prediction
  of properties ranging from coastal sea level to marine top predator distributions.
  We then describe known mechanisms governing marine ecosystem predictability and
  how they have been used in forecasts to date. These mechanisms include physical
  atmospheric and oceanic processes, biogeochemical and ecological responses to physical
  forcing, and intrinsic characteristics of species themselves. In reviewing the state
  of the knowledge on forecasting techniques and mechanisms underlying marine ecosystem
  predictability, we aim to facilitate forecast development and uptake by (i) identifying
  methods and processes that can be exploited for development of skillful regional
  forecasts, (ii) informing priorities for forecast development and verification,
  and (iii) improving understanding of conditional forecast skill (i.e., a priori
  knowledge of whether a forecast is likely to be skillful). While we focus primarily
  on coastal marine ecosystems surrounding North America (and the U.S. in particular),
  we detail forecast methods, physical and biological mechanisms, and priority developments
  that are globally relevant.
