abstract: Traditional machine learning and deep learning techniques rely on correlation-based
  learning, often failing to distinguish spurious associations from true causal relationships,
  which limits robustness, interpretability, and generalizability. To address these
  challenges, we propose a causality-driven deep learning framework that integrates
  Multivariate Granger Causality (MVGC) and PCMCI+ causal discovery algorithms with
  a hybrid deep learning architecture. Using 43 years (1979-2021) of daily and monthly
  Arctic Sea Ice Extent (SIE) and ocean-atmospheric datasets, our approach identifies
  causally significant factors, prioritizes features with direct influence, reduces
  feature overhead, and improves computational efficiency. Experiments demonstrate
  that integrating causal features enhances the deep learning model's predictive accuracy
  and interpretability across multiple lead times. Beyond SIE prediction, the proposed
  framework offers a scalable solution for dynamic, high-dimensional systems, advancing
  both theoretical understanding and practical applications in predictive modeling.
