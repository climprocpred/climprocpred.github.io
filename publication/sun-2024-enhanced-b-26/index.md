abstract: We investigate the impact of ocean data assimilation using the Ensemble
  Adjustment Kalman Filter (EAKF) from the Data Assimilation Research Testbed (DART)
  on the oceanic and atmospheric states of the Red Sea. Our study extends the ocean
  data assimilation experiment performed by Sanikommu et al. (2020) by utilizing the
  SKRIPS model coupling the MITgcm ocean model and the Weather Research and Forecasting
  (WRF) atmosphere model. Using a 50-member ensemble, we assimilate satellite-derived
  sea surface temperature and height and in-situ temperature and salinity profiles
  every three days for one year, starting January 01 2011. Atmospheric data are not
  assimilated in the experiments. To improve the ensemble realism, perturbations are
  added to the WRF model using several physics options and the stochastic kinetic
  energy backscatter (SKEB) scheme. Compared with the control experiments using uncoupled
  MITgcm with ECMWF ensemble forcing, the EAKF ensemble mean oceanic states from the
  coupled model are better or insignificantly worse (root-mean-square-errors are 30%
  to -2% smaller), especially when the atmospheric model uncertainties are accounted
  for with stochastic perturbations. We hypothesize that the ensemble spreads of the
  air–sea fluxes are better represented in the downscaled WRF ensembles when uncertainties
  are well accounted for, leading to improved representation of the ensemble oceanic
  states in EAKF. Although the feedback from ocean to atmosphere is included in this
  two-way regional coupled configuration, we find no significant effect of ocean data
  assimilation on the latent heat flux and 10-m wind speed, suggesting the improved
  skill is from downscaling the ensemble atmospheric forcings.
