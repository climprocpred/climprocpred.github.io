abstract: Scientific discoveries are often made by finding a pattern or object that
  was not predicted by the known rules of science. Oftentimes, these anomalous events
  or objects that do not conform to the norms are an indication that the rules of
  science governing the data are incomplete, and something new needs to be present
  to explain these unexpected outliers. The challenge of finding anomalies can be
  confounding since it requires codifying a complete knowledge of the known scientific
  behaviors and then projecting these known behaviors on the data to look for deviations.
  When utilizing machine learning, this presents a particular challenge since we require
  that the model not only understands scientific data perfectly but also recognizes
  when the data is inconsistent and out of the scope of its trained behavior. In this
  paper, we present three datasets aimed at developing machine learning-based anomaly
  detection for disparate scientific domains covering astrophysics, genomics, and
  polar science. We present the different datasets along with a scheme to make machine
  learning challenges around the three datasets findable, accessible, interoperable,
  and reusable (FAIR). Furthermore, we present an approach that generalizes to future
  machine learning challenges, enabling the possibility of large, more compute-intensive
  challenges that can ultimately lead to scientific discovery.
