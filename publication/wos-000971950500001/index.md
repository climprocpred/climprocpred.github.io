abstract: There is currently large uncertainty over the impacts of climate change    on
  precipitation trends over the US west coast. Atmospheric rivers (ARs) are a significant
  source of US west coast precipitation and trends in ARs can provide insight into
  future precipitation trends. There are already a variety of different methods used
  to identify ARs, but many are used in contexts that are often difficult to apply
  to large climate datasets due to their computational cost and requirement of integrated
  vapor transport as an input variable, which can be expensive to compute in climate
  models at high temporal frequencies. Using deep learning (DL) to track ARs is a
  unique approach that can alleviate some of the computational challenges that exist
  in more traditional methods. However, some questions still remain regarding its
  flexibility and robustness. This research investigates the consistency of a DL methodology
  of tracking ARs with more established algorithms to demonstrate its high-level performance
  for future studies.Plain Language Summary Atmospheric rivers (ARs) are long corridors
  of water vapor in the lower atmosphere that are associated with a large amount of
  precipitation on the US west coast. They are important to investigate in future
  climate change scenarios. To further understand them in climate change scenarios,
  they must be tracked in large datasets. We demonstrate the efficiency, effectiveness,
  and flexibility of a machine learning tracking method by comparing it to more established
  existing tracking methods. This method applies particularly well to large climate
  datasets and can be useful for future studies.
