 abstract = {There is currently large uncertainty over the impacts of climate change    on precipitation trends over the US west coast. Atmospheric rivers (ARs)
are a significant source of US west coast precipitation and trends in
ARs can provide insight into future precipitation trends. There are
already a variety of different methods used to identify ARs, but many
are used in contexts that are often difficult to apply to large climate
datasets due to their computational cost and requirement of integrated
vapor transport as an input variable, which can be expensive to compute
in climate models at high temporal frequencies. Using deep learning (DL)
to track ARs is a unique approach that can alleviate some of the
computational challenges that exist in more traditional methods.
However, some questions still remain regarding its flexibility and
robustness. This research investigates the consistency of a DL
methodology of tracking ARs with more established algorithms to
demonstrate its high-level performance for future studies.Plain Language
Summary Atmospheric rivers (ARs) are long corridors of water vapor in
the lower atmosphere that are associated with a large amount of
precipitation on the US west coast. They are important to investigate in
future climate change scenarios. To further understand them in climate
change scenarios, they must be tracked in large datasets. We demonstrate
the efficiency, effectiveness, and flexibility of a machine learning
tracking method by comparing it to more established existing tracking
methods. This method applies particularly well to large climate datasets
and can be useful for future studies.},
