 abstract = {The Climate SPHINX (Stochastic Physics HIgh resolutioN eXperiments)    project is a comprehensive set of ensemble simulations aimed at
evaluating the sensitivity of present and future climate to model
resolution and stochastic parameterisation. The EC-Earth Earth system
model is used to explore the impact of stochastic physics in a large
ensemble of 30-year climate integrations at five different atmospheric
horizontal resolutions (from 125 up to 16 km). The project includes more
than 120 simulations in both a historical scenario (1979-2008) and a
climate change projection (2039-2068), together with coupled transient
runs (1850-2100). A total of 20.4 million core hours have been used,
made available from a single year grant from PRACE (the Partnership for
Advanced Computing in Europe), and close to 1.5 PB of output data have
been produced on SuperMUC IBM Petascale System at the Leibniz
Supercomputing Centre (LRZ) in Garching, Germany. About 140 TB of
postprocessed data are stored on the CINECA supercomputing centre
archives and are freely accessible to the community thanks to an EUDAT
data pilot project. This paper presents the technical and scientific
set-up of the experiments, including the details on the forcing used for
the simulations performed, defining the SPHINX v1.0 protocol. In
addition, an overview of preliminary results is given. An improvement in
the simulation of Euro-Atlantic atmospheric blocking following
resolution increase is observed. It is also shown that including
stochastic parameterisation in the low-resolution runs helps to improve
some aspects of the tropical climate -specifically the Madden-Julian
Oscillation and the tropical rainfall variability. These findings show
the importance of representing the impact of small-scale processes on
the large-scale climate variability either explicitly (with
highresolution simulations) or stochastically (in low-resolution
simulations).},
