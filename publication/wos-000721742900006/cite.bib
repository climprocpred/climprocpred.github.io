 abstract = {In the Bay of Bengal, the warm, dry boreal spring concludes with the    onset of the summer monsoon and accompanying southwesterly winds, heavy
rains, and variable air-sea fluxes. Here, we summarize the 2018 monsoon
onset using observations collected through the multinational Monsoon
Intraseasonal Oscillations in the Bay of Bengal (MISO-BoB) program
between the United States, India, and Sri Lanka. MISO-BoB aims to
improve understanding of monsoon intraseasonal variability, and the 2018
field effort captured the coupled air-sea response during a transition
from active-to-break conditions in the central BoB. The active phase of
the similar to 20-day research cruise was characterized by warm sea
surface temperature (SST > 30 degrees C), cold atmospheric outflows with
intermittent heavy rainfall, and increasing winds (from 2 to 15 m
s(-1)). Accumulated rainfall exceeded 200 mm with 90% of precipitation
occurring during the first week. The following break period was both dry
and clear, with persistent 10-12 m s(-1) wind and evaporation of 0.2 mm
h(-1). The evolving environmental state included a deepening ocean mixed
layer (from similar to 20 to 50 m), cooling SST (by similar to 1 degrees
C), and warming/drying of the lower to midtroposphere. Local atmospheric
development was consistent with phasing of the large-scale intraseasonal
oscillation. The upper ocean stores significant heat in the BoB, enough
to maintain SST above 29 degrees C despite cooling by surface fluxes and
ocean mixing. Comparison with reanalysis indicates biases in air-sea
fluxes, which may be related to overly cool prescribed SST. Resolution
of such biases offers a path toward improved forecasting of transition
periods in the monsoon.},
