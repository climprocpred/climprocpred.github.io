abstract: Abstract A Denver newspaper in 2016 reported that a new Colorado all-time
  record peak wind gust of 148 mph was recorded on 18 February 2016, on Monarch Pass
  in the Colorado Rockies near 11 000 ft above sea level. The article stated that
  this broke the previous record of 147 mph set on 25 January 1971 at the National
  Science Foundation (NSF) National Center for Atmospheric Research (NCAR) Mesa Laboratory,
  at an altitude of 6077 ft, on the western edge of Boulder, Colorado. Though there
  is no actual official peak gust record in Colorado, this raised the issue that Boulder
  had not recently experienced winds of the magnitude of the megadownslope windstorms
  that wracked the area in the 1960s, 1970s, and 1980s when extreme wind gusts recorded
  at the NSF NCAR Mesa Laboratory were not unusual. Due to Boulder’s location at the
  eastern foot of a north–south mountain range ( Earth ), it is susceptible to destructive
  downslope winds ( wind ) often accompanied by fires ( fire ) such as the downslope
  wind-driven Marshall Fire just east of Boulder on 30 December 2021 that destroyed
  nearly 1100 homes. But after the 1990s, the weather station anemometer at NSF NCAR
  did not record a peak gust much over 100 mph. What changed? This detective story
  describes the search for causes of the apparent decrease in strength of extreme
  windstorms at NSF NCAR and their impacts in the Boulder area. The suspects in Boulder
  include a change in instrument location, changes in building codes, and increasing
  roughness length from tree growth. But climate change emerges as a chief culprit.
  Significance Statement National Science Foundation (NSF) National Center for Atmospheric
  Research (NCAR) was at the epicenter of megadownslope windstorms that wracked Boulder
  in the 1960s, 1970s, and 1980s when extreme windstorms were not unusual. But after
  the 1990s, the weather station anemometer at NSF NCAR, which replaced the previous
  anemometer that recorded the huge gusts, did not record a peak gust much over 100
  mph. What changed? This detective story describes the search for causes of the apparent
  decrease in strength of extreme winds at NSF NCAR and their impacts in the Boulder
  area. Changing instrument location is part of the story, but climate change emerges
  as a key culprit.
