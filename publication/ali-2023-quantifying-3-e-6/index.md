abstract: The warming of the Arctic, also known as Arctic amplification, is led by
  several atmospheric and oceanic drivers. However, the details of its underlying
  thermodynamic causes are still unknown. Inferring the causal effects of atmospheric
  processes on sea ice melt using fixed treatment effect strategies leads to unrealistic
  counterfactual estimations. Such models are also prone to bias due to time-varying
  confoundedness. Further, the complex non-linearity in Earth science data makes it
  infeasible to perform causal inference using existing marginal structural techniques.
  In order to tackle these challenges, we propose TCINet - time-series causal inference
  model to infer causation under continuous treatment using recurrent neural networks
  and a novel probabilistic balancing technique. Through experiments on synthetic
  and observational data, we show how our research can substantially improve the ability
  to quantify leading causes of Arctic sea ice melt, further paving paths for causal
  inference in observational Earth science.
