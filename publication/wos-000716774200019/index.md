abstract: Landfalling atmospheric rivers (ARs) over the western US are responsible    for
  similar to 30%-50 % of the annual precipitation, and their accurate forecasts are
  essential for aiding water management decisions and reducing flood risks. Sparse
  coverage of conventional observations over the Pacific Ocean, which can cause inadequate
  upstream initial conditions for numerical weather prediction models, may limit the
  improvement of forecast skill for these events. A targeted field program called
  AR Reconnaissance (Recon) was initiated in 2016 to better understand and reduce
  forecast errors of landfalling ARs at 1-5 days lead times. During the winter seasons
  of 2016, 2018, and 2019, 15 Intensive Observation Periods (IOPs) sampled the upstream
  conditions for landfalling ARs. This study evaluates the impact on forecast accuracy
  of assimilating these dropsonde data. Data denial experiments with (WithDROP) and
  without (NoDROP) dropsonde data were conducted using the Weather Research and Forecasting
  model with the Gridpoint Statistical Interpolation four-dimensional ensemble variational
  system. Comparisons between the 15 paired NoDROP and WithDROP experiments demonstrate
  that AR Recon dropsondes reduced the root-mean-square error in integrated vapor
  transport (IVT) and inland precipitation for more than 70 % of the IOPs, averaged
  over all forecast lead times from 1 to 6 days. Dropsondes have improved the spatial
  pattern of forecasts of IVT and precipitation in all 15 IOPs. Significant improvements
  in skill are found beyond the short range (1-2 days). IOP sequences (i.e., back-to-back
  IOPs every other day) show the most improvement of inland precipitation forecast
  skill.
