abstract: Sea level anomaly (SLA) data spanning 1992–2012 were analyzed to study the
  statistical properties of eddies in the Red Sea. An algorithm that identifies winding
  angles was employed to detect 4998 eddies propagating along 938 unique eddy tracks.
  Statistics suggest that eddies are generated across the entire Red Sea but that
  they are prevalent in certain regions. A high number of eddies is found in the central
  basin between 18°N and 24°N. More than 87% of the detected eddies have a radius
  ranging from 50 to 135 km. Both the intensity and relative vorticity scale of these
  eddies decrease as the eddy radii increase. The averaged eddy lifespan is approximately
  6 weeks. AEs and cyclonic eddies (CEs) have different deformation features, and
  those with stronger intensities are less deformed and more circular. Analysis of
  long‐lived eddies suggests that they are likely to appear in the central basin with
  AEs tending to move northward. In addition, their eddy kinetic energy (EKE) increases
  gradually throughout their lifespans. The annual cycles of CEs and AEs differ, although
  both exhibit significant seasonal cycles of intensity with the winter and summer
  peaks appearing in February and August, respectively. The seasonal cycle of EKE
  is negatively correlated with stratification but positively correlated with vertical
  shear of horizontal velocity and eddy growth rate, suggesting that the generation
  of baroclinic instability is responsible for the activities of eddies in the Red
  Sea. The first study of eddy statistical properties in the Red Sea The first study
  of vertical dynamics of eddies to in the Red Sea Extension of the winding‐angle
  eddy identification algorithm to the Red Sea
