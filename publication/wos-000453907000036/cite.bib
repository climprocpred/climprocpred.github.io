 abstract = {Adjoint sensitivity analysis is applied to a set of eddies in the Red    Sea using a high-resolution Massachusetts Institute of Technology
general circulation model and its adjoint model. Previous studies have
reported several eddy events in the Red Sea, namely, a dipole captured
on 17 August 2001 in the southern Red Sea, a cyclonic eddy in November
2011 in the northern Red Sea, and an anticyclonic eddy in April 2010 in
the central Red Sea. Sensitivity analysis is applied here to investigate
the governing factors that control the intensity and evolution of these
eddies. The eddies are first reproduced by running the Massachusetts
Institute of Technology general circulation model forward and their
sensitivities to external atmospheric forcing and previous model states
are then computed using the adjoint model. In the experiments,
(relative) surface vorticity (curl of horizontal velocity) is defined as
the objective function. The contributions of forcings and model states
are quantified and investigated. The sensitivities to external forcings
are distinct in different eddy events. The dipole in the central Red Sea
is dominantly sensitive to the cross-basin eastward wind jet. The
anticyclonic eddy in the central Red Sea is most sensitive to the
along-basin wind stress. The cyclonic eddy in the northern Red Sea is
sensitive to the net heat flux and to surface elevation perturbations
even from the remote southern Red Sea, which is attributed to the
propagation of baroclinic Kelvin waves along the coast. Analysis of the
sensitivity to model state variables suggests that these eddies are also
modulated by the boundary currents and the temperature profile
distributions.
Plain Language Summary This is the first quantitative sensitivity
studies on the mechanisms of eddies in the Red Sea using adjoint method.
The comprehensive discussion reveals the governing factors that control
the intensity and evolution of these eddies.},
