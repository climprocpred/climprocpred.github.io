abstract: Adjoint sensitivity analysis is applied to a set of eddies in the Red    Sea
  using a high-resolution Massachusetts Institute of Technology general circulation
  model and its adjoint model. Previous studies have reported several eddy events
  in the Red Sea, namely, a dipole captured on 17 August 2001 in the southern Red
  Sea, a cyclonic eddy in November 2011 in the northern Red Sea, and an anticyclonic
  eddy in April 2010 in the central Red Sea. Sensitivity analysis is applied here
  to investigate the governing factors that control the intensity and evolution of
  these eddies. The eddies are first reproduced by running the Massachusetts Institute
  of Technology general circulation model forward and their sensitivities to external
  atmospheric forcing and previous model states are then computed using the adjoint
  model. In the experiments, (relative) surface vorticity (curl of horizontal velocity)
  is defined as the objective function. The contributions of forcings and model states
  are quantified and investigated. The sensitivities to external forcings are distinct
  in different eddy events. The dipole in the central Red Sea is dominantly sensitive
  to the cross-basin eastward wind jet. The anticyclonic eddy in the central Red Sea
  is most sensitive to the along-basin wind stress. The cyclonic eddy in the northern
  Red Sea is sensitive to the net heat flux and to surface elevation perturbations
  even from the remote southern Red Sea, which is attributed to the propagation of
  baroclinic Kelvin waves along the coast. Analysis of the sensitivity to model state
  variables suggests that these eddies are also modulated by the boundary currents
  and the temperature profile distributions. Plain Language Summary This is the first
  quantitative sensitivity studies on the mechanisms of eddies in the Red Sea using
  adjoint method. The comprehensive discussion reveals the governing factors that
  control the intensity and evolution of these eddies.
