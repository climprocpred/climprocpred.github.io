 abstract = {The early twentieth-century warming (EW; 1910-45) and the    mid-twentieth-century cooling (MC; 1950-80) have been linked to both
internal variability of the climate system and changes in external
radiative forcing. The degree to which either of the two factors
contributed to EW and MC, or both, is still debated. Using a two-box
impulse response model, we demonstrate that multidecadal ocean
variability was unlikely to be the driver of observed changes in global
mean surface temperature (GMST) after AD 1850. Instead, virtually all
(97%-98\ %) of the global low-frequency variability (>30 years) can be
explained by external forcing. We find similarly high percentages of
explained variance for interhemispheric and land-ocean temperature
evolution. Three key aspects are identified that underpin the conclusion
of this new study: inhomogeneous anthropogenic aerosol forcing (AER),
biases in the instrumental sea surface temperature (SST) datasets, and
inadequate representation of the response to varying forcing factors.
Once the spatially heterogeneous nature of AER is accounted for, the MC
period is reconcilable with external drivers. SST biases and imprecise
forcing responses explain the putative disagreement between models and
observations during the EW period. As a consequence, Atlantic
multidecadal variability (AMV) is found to be primarily controlled by
external forcing too. Future attribution studies should account for
these important factors when discriminating between externally forced
and internally generated influences on climate. We argue that AMV must
not be used as a regressor and suggest a revised AMV index instead
[the North Atlantic Variability Index (NAVI)]. Our associated best
estimate for the transient climate response (TCR) is 1.57 K (+/- 0.70 at
the 5\ %-95\ % confidence level).},
