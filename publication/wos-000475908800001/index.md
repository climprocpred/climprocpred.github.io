abstract: 'The early twentieth-century warming (EW; 1910-45) and the    mid-twentieth-century
  cooling (MC; 1950-80) have been linked to both internal variability of the climate
  system and changes in external radiative forcing. The degree to which either of
  the two factors contributed to EW and MC, or both, is still debated. Using a two-box
  impulse response model, we demonstrate that multidecadal ocean variability was unlikely
  to be the driver of observed changes in global mean surface temperature (GMST) after
  AD 1850. Instead, virtually all (97%-98 %) of the global low-frequency variability
  (>30 years) can be explained by external forcing. We find similarly high percentages
  of explained variance for interhemispheric and land-ocean temperature evolution.
  Three key aspects are identified that underpin the conclusion of this new study:
  inhomogeneous anthropogenic aerosol forcing (AER), biases in the instrumental sea
  surface temperature (SST) datasets, and inadequate representation of the response
  to varying forcing factors. Once the spatially heterogeneous nature of AER is accounted
  for, the MC period is reconcilable with external drivers. SST biases and imprecise
  forcing responses explain the putative disagreement between models and observations
  during the EW period. As a consequence, Atlantic multidecadal variability (AMV)
  is found to be primarily controlled by external forcing too. Future attribution
  studies should account for these important factors when discriminating between externally
  forced and internally generated influences on climate. We argue that AMV must not
  be used as a regressor and suggest a revised AMV index instead [the North Atlantic
  Variability Index (NAVI)]. Our associated best estimate for the transient climate
  response (TCR) is 1.57 K (+/- 0.70 at the 5 %-95 % confidence level).'
