abstract: Water management and flood control are major challenges in the western    United
  States. They are heavily influenced by atmospheric river (AR) storms that produce
  both beneficial water supply and hazards; for example, 84% of all flood damages
  in the West (up to 99 % in key areas) are associated with ARs. However, AR landfall
  forecast position errors can exceed 200 km at even 1-day lead time and yet many
  watersheds are <100 km across, which contributes to issues such as the 2017 Oroville
  Dam spillway incident and regularly to large flood forecast errors. Combined with
  the rise of wildfires and deadly post-wildfire debris flows, such as Montecito (2018),
  the need for better AR forecasts is urgent. Atmospheric River Reconnaissance (AR
  Recon) was developed as a research and operations partnership to address these needs.
  It combines new observations, modeling, data assimilation, and forecast verification
  methods to improve the science and predictions of landfalling ARs. ARs over the
  northeast Pacific are measured using dropsondes from up to three aircraft simultaneously.
  Additionally, airborne radio occultation is being tested, and drifting buoys with
  pressure sensors are deployed. AR targeting and data collection methods have been
  developed, assimilation and forecast impact experiments are ongoing, and better
  understanding of AR dynamics is emerging. AR Recon is led by the Center for Western
  Weather and Water Extremes and NWS/NCEP. The effort's core partners include the
  U.S. Navy, U.S. Air Force, NCAR, ECMWF, and multiple academic institutions. AR Recon
  is included in the ``National Winter Season Operations Plan'' to support improved
  outcomes for emergency preparedness and water management in the West.
