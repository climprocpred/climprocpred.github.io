abstract: Despite the well-recognized initial value nature of the subseasonal    forecasts,
  the role of subsurface ocean initialization in subseasonal forecasts remains underexplored.
  Using observing system experiments, this study investigates the impact of ocean
  in situ data assimilation on the propagation of Madden-Julian Oscillation (MJO)
  events across the Maritime Continent in the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather
  Forecasts (ECMWF) subseasonal forecast system. Two sets of twin experiments are
  analyzed, which only differ on the use or not of in situ ocean observations in the
  initial conditions. Besides using the Real-time Multivariate MJO Index (RMMI) to
  evaluate the forecast performance, we also develop a new MJO tracking method based
  on outgoing longwave radiation anomalies (OLRa) for forecast evaluation. We find
  that the ocean initialization with in situ data assimilation, though having an impact
  on the forecasted ocean mean state, does not improve the relatively low MJO forecast
  skill across the Maritime Continent. Moist static energy budget analysis further
  suggests that a significant underestimation in the meridional moisture advection
  in the model forecast may hinder the potential role played by the ocean state differences
  associated with data assimilation. Bias of the intraseasonal meridional winds in
  the model is a more important factor for such underestimation than the mean state
  moisture biases. This finding suggests that atmospheric model biases dominate the
  forecast error growth, and the atmospheric circulation bias is one of the major
  sources of the MJO prediction error and should be a target for improving the ECMWF
  subseasonal forecast model.
