abstract: Members in ensemble forecasts differ due to the representations of    initial
  uncertainties and model uncertainties. The inclusion of stochastic schemes to represent
  model uncertainties has improved the probabilistic skill of the ECMWF ensemble by
  increasing reliability and reducing the error of the ensemble mean. Recent progress,
  challenges and future directions regarding stochastic representations of model uncertainties
  at ECMWF are described in this article. The coming years are likely to see a further
  increase in the use of ensemble methods in forecasts and assimilation. This will
  put increasing demands on the methods used to perturb the forecast model. An area
  that is receiving greater attention than 5-10 years ago is the physical consistency
  of the perturbations. Other areas where future efforts will be directed are the
  expansion of uncertainty representations to the dynamical core and other components
  of the Earth system, as well as the overall computational efficiency of representing
  model uncertainty.
