 abstract = {Members in ensemble forecasts differ due to the representations of    initial uncertainties and model uncertainties. The inclusion of
stochastic schemes to represent model uncertainties has improved the
probabilistic skill of the ECMWF ensemble by increasing reliability and
reducing the error of the ensemble mean. Recent progress, challenges and
future directions regarding stochastic representations of model
uncertainties at ECMWF are described in this article. The coming years
are likely to see a further increase in the use of ensemble methods in
forecasts and assimilation. This will put increasing demands on the
methods used to perturb the forecast model. An area that is receiving
greater attention than 5-10 years ago is the physical consistency of the
perturbations. Other areas where future efforts will be directed are the
expansion of uncertainty representations to the dynamical core and other
components of the Earth system, as well as the overall computational
efficiency of representing model uncertainty.},
