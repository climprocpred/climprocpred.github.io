 abstract = {The effect of polar sea ice melt on low latitude climate is little    known. To understand the response of the Indian summer monsoon (ISM)
synoptic activity to the sea ice melt, we have run a suite of coupled
and uncoupled climate model simulations. In one set of simulations, the
albedo of sea ice is reduced so that it would melt due to increased
absorption of solar radiation. The coupled model simulation with a
reduced sea ice albedo resulted in an almost complete melting of the sea
ice in summer in both hemispheres. A high-resolution (50 km) atmospheric
general circulation model (AGCM) is forced with the climatological
annual cycles of sea surface temperature (SST) and sea ice
concentrations (SIC) from the coupled model outputs to better resolve
synoptic scale variability. In the high-resolution AGCM simulations
forced with SST and SIC from the sea ice melt experiments, the ISM
circulation weakened substantially, and the monsoon low-pressure systems
(LPS) activity experienced an overall decline of 23%, with a widespread
weakening in the south and a moderate strengthening over the north, in
response to a decline of 78\ % (24\ %) in SIC over the Arctic (Antarctic)
in the June-September season. The changes in the LPS activity in
response to polar sea ice melt are found to be mostly driven by the
changes in low-level absolute vorticity and vertical shear over the Bay
of Bengal.
Plain Language Summary The sea ice is melting rapidly in a warming
climate, which can have feedback effects on the climate system. However,
the impact of sea ice melt on low latitude climate is not adequately
understood. The Indian summer monsoon (ISM), known as the lifeline of
South Asia, is essential to the water security of more than 1.5 billion
people. We examined the response of the ISM to the polar sea ice melt
using a suite of global climate model experiments. Our simulations show
that the monsoon circulation and rainfall weaken substantially due to
the sea ice melt. Further, the number of propagating precipitating
vortices embedded in the monsoon circulation declined by about 22\ % in
the sea ice melt experiments. Our results suggest that the Arctic and
Antarctic sea ice melt could have severe implications for the water
security of South Asia.},
