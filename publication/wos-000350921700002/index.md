abstract: The California Current System (CCS) has been studied by the California    Cooperative
  Oceanic Fisheries Investigations program for many decades. Since 2004, the Southern
  California Bight (SCB) and the oceanic region offshore has also been the site for
  the California Current Ecosystem (CCE) Long-Term Ecological Research (LTER) program,
  which has established long-term observational time series and executed several Process
  Cruises to better understand physical biological variations, fluxes and interactions.
  Since the inception of the CCE-LTER, many new ideas have emerged about what physical
  processes are the key controls on CCS dynamics. These new perspectives include obtaining
  a better understanding of what climate patterns exert influences on CCS physical
  variations and what physical controls are most important in driving CCE ecological
  changes. Physical oceanographic and climatological conditions in the CCS varied
  widely since the inception of the CCE-LTER observational time series, including
  unusual climate events and persistently anomalous states. Although the CCE-LTER
  project commenced in 2004 in the midst of normal ocean conditions near the climatological
  means, over the following decade, El Nino/Southern Oscillation conditions flickered
  weakly from warm to cold, with the Pacific Decadal Oscillation (PDO) generally tracking
  that behavior, while the North Pacific Gyre Oscillation (NPGO) evolved to persistent
  and strong positive conditions after 2007, indicative of enhanced upwelling from
  2007 to 2012. Together the combined impact of the negative PDO state (La Nina conditions)
  and positive NPGO state (increased upwelling conditions) yielded remarkably persistent
  cool conditions in the CCS from late 2007 to early 2009 and from mid-2010 through
  2012. The broad-scale climate variations that occurred over the North Pacific and
  CCS during this time period are discussed here to provide physical context for the
  CCE-LTER time series observations and the CCE-LTER Process Cruises. Data assimilation
  fits, using the Regional Ocean Modeling System four-dimensional data assimilation
  framework, were successfully executed for the 1-month time period surrounding each
  of the Process Cruises. The fits provide additional information about how the physical
  flows evolve during the course of the multi-week Process Cruises. Relating these
  physical states to the numerous biological measurements gathered by the CCE-LTER
  time series observations and during the Process Cruises will yield vital long-term
  perspective of how changing climate conditions control the ocean ecosystem in this
  region and information on how this important ecosystem can be expected to evolve
  over the coming decades. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.
