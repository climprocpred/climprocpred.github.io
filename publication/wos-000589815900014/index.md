abstract: A key aim of observational campaigns is to sample atmosphere-ocean    phenomena
  to improve understanding of these phenomena, and in turn, numerical weather prediction.
  In early 2018 and 2019, the Atmospheric River Reconnaissance (AR Recon) campaign
  released dropsondes and radiosondes into atmospheric rivers (ARs) over the northeast
  Pacific Ocean to collect unique observations of temperature, winds, and moisture
  in ARs. These narrow regions of water vapor transport in the atmosphere-like rivers
  in the sky-can be associated with extreme precipitation and flooding events in the
  midlatitudes. This study uses the dropsonde observations collected during the AR
  Recon campaign and the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF)
  Integrated Forecasting System (IFS) to evaluate forecasts of ARs. Results show that
  ECMWF IFS forecasts 1) were colder than observations by up to 0.6 K throughout the
  troposphere; 2) have a dry bias in the lower troposphere, which along with weaker
  winds below 950 hPa, resulted in weaker horizontal water vapor fluxes in the 950-1000-hPa
  layer; and 3) exhibit an underdispersiveness in the water vapor flux that largely
  arises from model representativeness errors associated with dropsondes. Four U.S.
  West Coast radiosonde sites confirm the IFS cold bias throughout winter. These issues
  are likely to affect the model's hydrological cycle and hence precipitation forecasts.
