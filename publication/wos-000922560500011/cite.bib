 abstract = {Under the Atmospheric River Reconnaissance (AR Recon) Program, ocean    drifting buoys (drifters) that provide surface pressure observations
were deployed in the northeastern Pacific Ocean to improve forecasts of
U.S. West Coast high-impact weather. We examine the impacts of both AR
Recon and non-AR Recon drifter observations in the U.S. Navy's global
atmospheric data assimilation (DA) and forecast system using data-denial
experiments and forecast sensitivity observation impact (FSOI) analysis,
which estimates the impact of each observation on the 24-h global
forecast error total energy. Considering all drifters in the eastern
North Pacific for the 2020 AR Recon season, FSOI indicates that most of
the beneficial impacts come from observations in the lowest quartile of
observed surface pressure values, particularly those taken late in the
DA window. Observations in the upper quartile have near-neutral impacts
on average and are slightly nonbeneficial when taken late in the DA
window. This may occur because the DA configuration used here does not
account for model biases, and innovation statistics show that the
forecast model has a low pressure bias at high pressures. Case studies
and other analyses indicate large beneficial impacts coming from
observations in regions with large surface pressure gradients and
integrated vapor transport, such as fronts and ARs. Data-denial
experiments indicate that the assimilation of AR Recon drifter
observations results in a better-constrained analysis at nearby non-AR
Recon drifter locations and counteracts the NAVGEM pressure bias.
Assimilating the AR Recon drifter observations improves 72- and 96-h
Northern Hemisphere forecasts of winds in the lower and middle
troposphere, and geopotential height in the lower, middle, and upper
troposphere. Significance StatementThe purpose of this study is to
understand how observations of atmospheric pressure at the ocean surface
provided by drifting buoys impact weather forecasts. Some of these
drifting buoys were deployed under a program to study atmospheric rivers
(ARs) to improve forecasts of high-impact weather on the West Coast. We
find that these observations are most effective at reducing forecast
errors when taken in regions near fronts and cyclones. The additional
drifting buoys deployed under the AR Reconnaissance project reduce
forecast errors at 72 and 96 h over North America and the Northern
Hemisphere. These results are important because they illustrate the
potential for improving forecasts by increasing the number of drifting
buoy surface pressure observations over the world oceans.},
