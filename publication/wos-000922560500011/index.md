abstract: Under the Atmospheric River Reconnaissance (AR Recon) Program, ocean    drifting
  buoys (drifters) that provide surface pressure observations were deployed in the
  northeastern Pacific Ocean to improve forecasts of U.S. West Coast high-impact weather.
  We examine the impacts of both AR Recon and non-AR Recon drifter observations in
  the U.S. Navy's global atmospheric data assimilation (DA) and forecast system using
  data-denial experiments and forecast sensitivity observation impact (FSOI) analysis,
  which estimates the impact of each observation on the 24-h global forecast error
  total energy. Considering all drifters in the eastern North Pacific for the 2020
  AR Recon season, FSOI indicates that most of the beneficial impacts come from observations
  in the lowest quartile of observed surface pressure values, particularly those taken
  late in the DA window. Observations in the upper quartile have near-neutral impacts
  on average and are slightly nonbeneficial when taken late in the DA window. This
  may occur because the DA configuration used here does not account for model biases,
  and innovation statistics show that the forecast model has a low pressure bias at
  high pressures. Case studies and other analyses indicate large beneficial impacts
  coming from observations in regions with large surface pressure gradients and integrated
  vapor transport, such as fronts and ARs. Data-denial experiments indicate that the
  assimilation of AR Recon drifter observations results in a better-constrained analysis
  at nearby non-AR Recon drifter locations and counteracts the NAVGEM pressure bias.
  Assimilating the AR Recon drifter observations improves 72- and 96-h Northern Hemisphere
  forecasts of winds in the lower and middle troposphere, and geopotential height
  in the lower, middle, and upper troposphere. Significance StatementThe purpose of
  this study is to understand how observations of atmospheric pressure at the ocean
  surface provided by drifting buoys impact weather forecasts. Some of these drifting
  buoys were deployed under a program to study atmospheric rivers (ARs) to improve
  forecasts of high-impact weather on the West Coast. We find that these observations
  are most effective at reducing forecast errors when taken in regions near fronts
  and cyclones. The additional drifting buoys deployed under the AR Reconnaissance
  project reduce forecast errors at 72 and 96 h over North America and the Northern
  Hemisphere. These results are important because they illustrate the potential for
  improving forecasts by increasing the number of drifting buoy surface pressure observations
  over the world oceans.
