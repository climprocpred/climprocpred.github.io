abstract: Waves generated by tropical cyclones can have devastating effects on    coastal
  regions. However, the role of ocean currents in modifying wave amplitudes, wavelengths,
  and directions is commonly overlooked in wave forecasts, despite the fact that these
  interactions can lead to extreme wave conditions. Here, we use satellite observations
  and wave modeling to quantify the effects of ocean currents on the surface waves
  generated during a tropical cyclone event in the Arabian Sea. As a case study, this
  paper documents beams of wave heights originating from the eye-wall of a tropical
  cyclone caused by current-induced refraction. Alternating regions of high and low
  wave heights in the model simulations are consistent with observations and extend
  for thousands of kilometers all the way to 100 m isobath. Our results highlight
  the importance of accounting for wave refraction by currents in order to accurately
  predict the impact of tropical cyclone generated waves on coastal regions. Plain
  Language Summary Waves generated by tropical cyclones can have devastating effects
  on coastal regions. Ocean currents can modify wave heights and lead to extreme wave
  conditions. Here, we use satellite observations and wave modeling to quantify the
  effects of ocean currents on the waves during a tropical cyclone event in the Arabian
  Sea. In this paper, we documented the coherent beams of wave heights originating
  from the ``center'' of a tropical cyclone caused by current-induced effects. Alternating
  regions of high and low wave heights in the model simulations are consistent with
  observations and extend for thousands of kilometers all the way to 100 m isobath.
  Our results highlight the importance of accounting for the currents in order to
  accurately predict the impact of tropical cyclone generated waves on coastal regions.
