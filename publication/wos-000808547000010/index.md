abstract: Deep-learning (DL) postprocessing methods are examined to obtain    reliable
  and accurate probabilistic forecasts from single-member numerical weather predictions
  of integrated vapor transport (IVT). Using a 34-yr reforecast, based on the Center
  for Western Weather and Water Extremes West-WRF mesoscale model of North American
  West Coast IVT, the dynamically/statistically derived 0-120-h probabilistic forecasts
  for IVT under atmospheric river (AR) conditions are tested. These predictions are
  compared with the Global Ensemble Forecast System (GEFS) dynamic model and the GEFS
  calibrated with a neural network. In addition, the DL methods are tested against
  an established, but more rigid, statistical-dynamical ensemble method (the analog
  ensemble). The findings show, using continuous ranked probability skill score and
  Brier skill score as verification metrics, that the DL methods compete with or outperform
  the calibrated GEFS system at lead times from 0 to 48 h and again from 72 to 120
  h for AR vapor transport events. In addition, the DL methods generate reliable and
  skillful probabilistic forecasts. The implications of varying the length of the
  training dataset are examined, and the results show that the DL methods learn relatively
  quickly and similar to 10 years of hindcast data are required to compete with the
  GEFS ensemble.
