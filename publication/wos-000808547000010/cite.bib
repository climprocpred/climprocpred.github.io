 abstract = {Deep-learning (DL) postprocessing methods are examined to obtain    reliable and accurate probabilistic forecasts from single-member
numerical weather predictions of integrated vapor transport (IVT). Using
a 34-yr reforecast, based on the Center for Western Weather and Water
Extremes West-WRF mesoscale model of North American West Coast IVT, the
dynamically/statistically derived 0-120-h probabilistic forecasts for
IVT under atmospheric river (AR) conditions are tested. These
predictions are compared with the Global Ensemble Forecast System (GEFS)
dynamic model and the GEFS calibrated with a neural network. In
addition, the DL methods are tested against an established, but more
rigid, statistical-dynamical ensemble method (the analog ensemble). The
findings show, using continuous ranked probability skill score and Brier
skill score as verification metrics, that the DL methods compete with or
outperform the calibrated GEFS system at lead times from 0 to 48 h and
again from 72 to 120 h for AR vapor transport events. In addition, the
DL methods generate reliable and skillful probabilistic forecasts. The
implications of varying the length of the training dataset are examined,
and the results show that the DL methods learn relatively quickly and
similar to 10 years of hindcast data are required to compete with the
GEFS ensemble.},
