 abstract = {Developments in observing system technologies and ocean data    assimilation (DA) are symbiotic. New observation types lead to new DA
methods and new DA methods, such as coupled DA, can change the value of
existing observations or indicate where new observations can have
greater utility for monitoring and prediction. Practitioners of DA are
encouraged to make better use of observations that are already
available, for example, taking advantage of strongly coupled DA so that
ocean observations can be used to improve atmospheric analyses and vice
versa. Ocean reanalyses are useful for the analysis of climate as well
as the initialization of operational long-range prediction models. There
are many remaining challenges for ocean reanalyses due to biases and
abrupt changes in the ocean-observing system throughout its history, the
presence of biases and drifts in models, and the simplifying assumptions
made in DA solution methods. From a governance point of view, more
support is needed to bring the ocean-observing and DA communities
together. For prediction applications, there is wide agreement that
protocols are needed for rapid communication of ocean-observing data on
numerical weather prediction (NWP) timescales. There is potential for
new observation types to enhance the observing system by supporting
prediction on multiple timescales, ranging from the typical timescale of
NWP, covering hours to weeks, out to multiple decades. Better
communication between DA and observation communities is encouraged in
order to allow operational prediction centers the ability to provide
guidance for the design of a sustained and adaptive observing network.},
