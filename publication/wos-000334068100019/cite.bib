 abstract = {The change in Madden-Julian oscillation (MJO) amplitude and variance in    response to anthropogenic climate change is assessed in the 1A degrees
nominal resolution community climate system model, version 4 (CCSM4),
which has a reasonable representation of the MJO characteristics both
dynamically and statistically. The twentieth century CCSM4 run is
compared with the warmest twenty-first century projection
(representative concentration pathway 8.5, or RCP8.5). The last 20 years
of each simulation are compared in their MJO characteristics, including
spatial variance distributions of winds, precipitation and outgoing
longwave radiation, histograms of event amplitude, phase and duration,
and composite maps of phases. The RCP8.5 run exhibits increased variance
in intraseasonal precipitation, larger-amplitude MJO events, stronger
MJO rainfall in the central and eastern tropical Pacific, and a greater
frequency of MJO occurrence for phases corresponding to enhanced
rainfall in the Indian Ocean sector. These features are consistent with
the concept of an increased magnitude for the hydrological cycle under
greenhouse warming conditions. Conversely, the number of active MJO days
decreases and fewer weak MJO events occur in the future climate state.
These results motivate further study of these changes since tropical
rainfall variability plays such an important role in the region's
socio-economic well being.},
