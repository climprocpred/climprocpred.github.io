abstract: The change in Madden-Julian oscillation (MJO) amplitude and variance in    response
  to anthropogenic climate change is assessed in the 1A degrees nominal resolution
  community climate system model, version 4 (CCSM4), which has a reasonable representation
  of the MJO characteristics both dynamically and statistically. The twentieth century
  CCSM4 run is compared with the warmest twenty-first century projection (representative
  concentration pathway 8.5, or RCP8.5). The last 20 years of each simulation are
  compared in their MJO characteristics, including spatial variance distributions
  of winds, precipitation and outgoing longwave radiation, histograms of event amplitude,
  phase and duration, and composite maps of phases. The RCP8.5 run exhibits increased
  variance in intraseasonal precipitation, larger-amplitude MJO events, stronger MJO
  rainfall in the central and eastern tropical Pacific, and a greater frequency of
  MJO occurrence for phases corresponding to enhanced rainfall in the Indian Ocean
  sector. These features are consistent with the concept of an increased magnitude
  for the hydrological cycle under greenhouse warming conditions. Conversely, the
  number of active MJO days decreases and fewer weak MJO events occur in the future
  climate state. These results motivate further study of these changes since tropical
  rainfall variability plays such an important role in the region's socio-economic
  well being.
