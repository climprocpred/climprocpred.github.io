abstract: 'Initialized climate predictions offer distinct benefits for multiple    stakeholders.
  This Review discusses initialized prediction on subseasonal to seasonal (S2S), seasonal
  to interannual (S2I) and seasonal to decadal (S2D) timescales, highlighting potential
  for skilful predictions in the years to come. Initialized Earth System predictions
  are made by starting a numerical prediction model in a state as consistent as possible
  to observations and running it forward in time for up to 10 years. Skilful predictions
  at time slices from subseasonal to seasonal (S2S), seasonal to interannual (S2I)
  and seasonal to decadal (S2D) offer information useful for various stakeholders,
  ranging from agriculture to water resource management to human and infrastructure
  safety. In this Review, we examine the processes influencing predictability, and
  discuss estimates of skill across S2S, S2I and S2D timescales. There are encouraging
  signs that skilful predictions can be made: on S2S timescales, there has been some
  skill in predicting the Madden-Julian Oscillation and North Atlantic Oscillation;
  on S2I, in predicting the El Nino-Southern Oscillation; and on S2D, in predicting
  ocean and atmosphere variability in the North Atlantic region. However, challenges
  remain, and future work must prioritize reducing model error, more effectively communicating
  forecasts to users, and increasing process and mechanistic understanding that could
  enhance predictive skill and, in turn, confidence. As numerical models progress
  towards Earth System models, initialized predictions are expanding to include prediction
  of sea ice, air pollution, and terrestrial and ocean biochemistry that can bring
  clear benefit to society and various stakeholders.'
